except when subdivision (i)(2) applies, if an LEA's TISA allocation for the current
school year is less than the LEA's TISA allocation for the immediately preceding
school year, and if the LEA experienced disenrollment, then the department shall
allocate additional funds to the LEA such that the LEA's TISA allocation for the
current school year combined with the amount of any additional funds received
by the LEA pursuant to this subdivision (i)(1) is equal to the LEA's TISA allocation
for the immediately preceding school year.
(2) Beginning with TISA allocations for the 2027-2028 school year, if an
LEA has ever received additional funds under this subsection (i), and if an LEA's
TISA allocation for the current school year is less than the sum total of the LEA's
TISA allocation for the immediately preceding school year and the amount of any
additional funds received by the LEA pursuant to this subsection (i) for the
immediately preceding school year, then the department shall allocate additional

is equal to the sum total of the LEA's TISA allocation for the immediately
preceding school year and the amount of any additional funds received by the
LEA pursuant to this subsection (i) for the immediately preceding school year.

the LEA's non-virtual average daily membership for the immediately preceding
school year.
