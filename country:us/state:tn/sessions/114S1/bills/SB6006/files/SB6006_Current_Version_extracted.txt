against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the
authority, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution
nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created needs to be recorded. The
Perfection, Priority and Enforcement of Public Pledges and Liens Act, compiled in title 9,
chapter 22, applies to any pledge of the authority.
- 10 - 001900
