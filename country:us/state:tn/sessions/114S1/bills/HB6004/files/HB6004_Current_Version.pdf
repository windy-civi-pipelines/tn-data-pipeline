SECTION 7. The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not
constitute a part of the law enacted by this act. However, the Tennessee Code Commission is
requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act.
SECTION 8. Section 5 of this act takes effect July 1, 2025, the public welfare requiring
it. All other sections of this act take effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
