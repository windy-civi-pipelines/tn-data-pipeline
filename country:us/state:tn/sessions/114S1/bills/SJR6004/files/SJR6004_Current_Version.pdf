WHEREAS, this notable property is also listed in the Tennessee Register of Historic
Places; and
WHEREAS, located along historic Anderson Pike near the top of the famed W Road in
the Town of Walden on Signal Mountain, the Bachman-McCoy farm was listed in the National
Register for its association with significant events in American history, as Bachman family
members have played important roles in local politics, social reform causes, and environmental
preservation over the years; and

home; by 1918, the Bachmans had transformed the property into a full-time residence and

WHEREAS, Martha Bachman McCoy and her family became the farm's primary
residents circa 1940; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. McCoy and her daughter, Sally McCoy Garland, allowed the Town of
Walden to acquire the farm through a gift/sale, so that the land might serve the community as

WHEREAS, today, the property, known as McCoy Farm and Gardens, covers thirty-eight
acres and contains the historic home, barn, and outbuildings of the Bachman farming era, as

WHEREAS, McCoy Farm and Gardens is open daily, hosts various community events,
offers a venue for private events, and is enjoyed by the broader community for its natural beauty
and historic charm; and
WHEREAS, this General Assembly finds it appropriate to honor the Bachman-McCoy
family for their many contributions to social causes, environmental preservation, and good
citizenship and their generosity in giving their farm to the Walden community, so that present
and future generations may learn history and enjoy nature while visiting the property; now,
therefore,
