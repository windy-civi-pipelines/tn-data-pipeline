SECTION 8. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 55-50-306, is amended by adding
the following new subsections:
(g)
(1) As used in this subsection (g):

is the same person who holds the physical driver license. The department must
not collect any other biometric identifier.
(3) An entity contracting with the department to provide a mobile software
application or other method for utilizing a digital driver license system shall not

identifier in a separate and distinct manner from any terms and conditions
or other requests for consent; and
(B) Receives the person's clear and specific consent to capture
the biometric identifier each time.

identifier under state law, or pursuant to a subpoena issued by a court;
