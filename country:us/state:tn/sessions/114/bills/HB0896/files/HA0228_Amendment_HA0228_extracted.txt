(a) An agency shall not adopt a rule establishing numeric criteria or numeric

hazardous waste, as those terms are defined in title 68 and 69, that relates to drinking
water, water pollution control, hazardous substances, contaminated site remediation, air
quality, or solid or hazardous waste handling unless:
(1) Scientific and technical information relied on to support the rule is
based upon the best available science; and
(2) With respect to human health, the best available science establishes
a direct link, based on generally accepted scientific practice, to manifest bodily
harm in humans. In the absence of data from voluntary scientific studies on
humans, best available science can be based on tests performed on
experimental animal species or human and animal cells that indicate exposure at
or above the numeric criteria or numeric limits establishes a direct link, based on
