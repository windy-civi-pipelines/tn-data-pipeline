SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 237
By Massey
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Knoxville Webb
Spartans boys' basketball team upon winning
the Division II-AA state tournament.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lads is the Spartans boys' basketball team of
Webb School of Knoxville, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of
competitors and truly worthy of admiration by winning the 2025 TSSAA Division II-AA state
tournament; and
WHEREAS, after earning a bye in the first round, the Spartans bested Christian Brothers
44-35 in the quarterfinals to advance in their quest for the state championship; and
WHEREAS, playing in the Division II-AA state tournament at Tennessee Tech's Hooper
Eblen Center, Knoxville Webb crushed Ensworth 58-40 in their semi-final match-up and then
defeated Briarcrest 54-45 in the title game to bring home the Gold Ball trophy that signifies a
state champion; and
WHEREAS, the Spartans relied heavily upon the athleticism, leadership, and
determination of Division II-AA state tournament Most Valuable Player Cam Swearengen and
Owen Lentz, who was named to the All-Tournament team; and
WHEREAS, in their eighteenth trip to the state tournament, Knoxville Webb claimed their
second championship, having previously won it all in 2019 in their only previous title game
appearance; and

WHEREAS, the Knoxville boys' basketball team combined with their female counterparts
to demonstrate that two titles are "twice as nice" and celebrated the Lady Spartans 2025
Division II-AA state championship in equal measure with their own victory; and
WHEREAS, the following young men are proud to call themselves Spartans: Owen
Lentz, Jaylen Pompey, Tahj Bowers, Cam Swearengen, Javon Dirl, Alex Leeth, Wilson Luton,
Daran Taylor, Luke Neiss, Huston Torres, Schuyler Huck, and Shavar Young; and
WHEREAS, Knoxville Webb's superb performance would not have been possible
without the stellar leadership of Head Coach Ricky Norris and assistant coaches Zach Gulmire,
James Michel, Rashawn Rembert, and David Sanger and the unfailing support of the players'
families, their fans, and their community; and
WHEREAS, the members of the Knoxville Webb boys' basketball team epitomize all that
is good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in
competition while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, the perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent of this group of
young men not only made possible a championship season but also surely bode well for their
future success; and
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly find it appropriate to acknowledge
and applaud the Knoxville Webb Spartans for their outstanding season on the hardwood; now,
