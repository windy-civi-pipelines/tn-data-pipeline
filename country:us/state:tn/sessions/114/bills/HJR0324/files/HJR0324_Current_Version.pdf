HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 324
By Littleton
A RESOLUTION to commend Taiwan for its relations with the
United States and the State of Tennessee.
WHEREAS, Taiwan and the United States of America are long standing allies who both
deeply cherish the common values of democracy, peace, and prosperity; therefore, Taiwan
continues to pursue integrated diplomacy and serve the best interests of the Indo-Pacific region
by deepening ties with other like-minded nations, safeguarding regional security, and utilizing
Taiwan's technological and economic success to promote partnerships on mutual benefits; and
WHEREAS, China repeatedly exerts economic coercion, stages military drills directed
toward Taiwan, and distorts U.N. Resolution 2758 (XXVI), excluding Taiwan's participation from
international organizations, which results in global challenges to rule-based international order
and aggressive authoritarian expansionism; and
WHEREAS, Taiwan is the United States' eighth-largest trading partner, and the United
States is Taiwan's second-largest trading partner, with an estimated $128 billion worth of trade,
and Taiwan was Tennessee's seventh-largest import and eighteenth largest export market in
2023. The U.S. and Taiwan's first agreement entry that went into force under "U.S.-Taiwan
Initiative on 21st Century Trade" includes commitments on anti-corruption, good regulatory
practices, customs administration and trade facilitation, and small and medium-sized
enterprises; and
WHEREAS, Taiwan's Quanta Computer Nashville, Inc., a world-leading AI server
producer, is transforming Tennessee into the most powerful AI service in the United States.
Both Tennessee and Taiwan recognize the significance of cultivating human resources needed
in economy, technology, education, and academic research; now, therefore,
