who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lads is the Creek Wood High School Red
Hawks, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of competitors and truly
worthy of admiration by winning the TSSAA Division I state boys' bowling tournament while
posting a perfect 26-0 season record; and
WHEREAS, entering the state tournament without a single defeat and a 23-0 record, the
Red Hawks doubled the score on Bartlett 18-9 to emerge victorious in their quarterfinal match-
up and then defeated Chuckey-Doak 16-11 in the semi-final round; and
WHEREAS, in the final match, Creek Wood defeated Hardin County 15-12 to claim the
state title and bring home the gold; and
WHEREAS, contributing significantly to the Red Hawks' title run were Ethan Carr, Ethan
Cunningham, Brandon Felts, William Jones, Ethan King, Peter Lopez, Abram Monosmith ,
Jayden Morgan, Aidan Rymer, and Landon Spicer; and
WHEREAS, the Red Hawks' superb performance would not have been possible without
the stellar leadership of Head Coach Cassie Wright and assistant coaches Meg Haley, Casey
Patrick, and Scott Wright and the unfailing support of their families, their fans, and their
community; and
