SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 31
By Campbell
A RESOLUTION to recognize and honor the school custodians of
Tennessee.
WHEREAS, throughout the school year, the school custodians of Tennessee ensure the
children of the Volunteer State have clean, healthy, and safe learning environments; and
WHEREAS, the unsung heroes of our schools, custodians are hard-working individuals
who dedicate countless hours to clean and maintain our school buildings for our students and
school staff; and
WHEREAS, the work of school custodians is physically demanding and, depending on
the position, may require custodians to work varying shifts and possibly in several locations;
they may be part of a team or work independently, responsible for a multitude of duties; and
WHEREAS, in 1985, a national Custodian Appreciation Day was established to honor
these dedicated men and women, with October 2nd designated as the official day to celebrate
school custodians; and
WHEREAS, it is most appropriate that we recognize the many contributions of school
custodians to the State of Tennessee; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we recognize and honor the school custodians of
Tennessee, commending them for their dedication and the hard work they do day after day to
keep our schools clean and well maintained for the children of the Volunteer State.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
