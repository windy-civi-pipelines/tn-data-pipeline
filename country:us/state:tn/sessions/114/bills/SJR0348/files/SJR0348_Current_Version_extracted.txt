Richland 47-40 in their semifinal match-up to advance to the final; and
WHEREAS, facing Van Buren in the title game, Greenfield prevailed 49-46 in a close
contest to win the Gold Ball trophy that signifies a state champion, finishing the season with a
remarkable 30-6 record; and
WHEREAS, each of these young ladies holds Greenfield's small-town traditions close to
her heart and is proud to be a Lady Yellowjacket; the team members include Kylee McNeil, Ella
