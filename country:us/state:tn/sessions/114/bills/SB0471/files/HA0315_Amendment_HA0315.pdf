AMEND S e n ate Bill No. 471 House Bill No. 178*
by deleting the preamble and substituting instead:
WHEREAS, millennial women have come of age in an era marked by wage stagnation,
skyrocketing student debt, unaffordable housing, and the rising costs of child care and health
care, all of which make marriage and family formation increasingly out of reach; and
WHEREAS, over the past forty-five years, the decline in children living with married
parents reflects not a rejection of family values, but the growing economic instability that delays
or deters marriage and childbearing; and
WHEREAS, nearly a quarter of children today are raised outside of marriage, a statistic
driven less by personal choice and more by structural barriers that make partnership and
parenting financially precarious; and
WHEREAS, while children raised in stable, well-supported families tend to thrive, our
focus must be on creating conditions where all families, regardless of marital status, have
access to opportunity, security, and community support; and
WHEREAS, millennial women understand that marriage alone does not guarantee
economic stability, especially in a landscape of wage inequality, rising medical costs, and
inadequate family leave policies; and
WHEREAS, millennial women face a workforce that too often punishes caregiving and
undervalues women's labor, making the prospect of balancing work, marriage, and parenting an
overwhelming challenge; and

WHEREAS, millennials carry more student loan debt than any previous generation,
delaying milestones like homeownership, marriage, and childbearing well into their thirties and
beyond; and
WHEREAS, the high cost of child care, lack of affordable health care, and insufficient
parental support policies have led many women to delay or forgo having children entirely; and
WHEREAS, despite narratives that tie personal success to marriage and childbearing,
millennial women are redefining what it means to flourish, prioritizing financial independence,
community connection, and personal fulfillment; and
WHEREAS, building a society where family formation is a real choice, not an economic
gamble, requires addressing the root causes of inequality, investing in paid leave, child care,
health care, and housing, and creating fair economic conditions for all; now, therefore,
