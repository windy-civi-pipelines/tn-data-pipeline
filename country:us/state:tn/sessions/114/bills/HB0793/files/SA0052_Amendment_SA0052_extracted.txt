by deleting all language after the caption and substituting instead the following:
WHEREAS, in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), the United States Supreme Court
held that illegal alien children living in the United States could not be excluded from a free public
education based upon their immigration status; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that both the volume of illegal
immigration, and its commensurate drain on State resources, as well as federal immigration
policy have materially changed since 1982, when Plyler was decided; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that data from the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service, Office of Policy and Planning, Estimates of the Unauthorized
Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: 1990 to 2000, shows the "many States . . .
had relatively few unauthorized residents" when Plyler was decided, but have subsequently
"experienced rapid growth of the unauthorized population"; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that data from the U.S. Department
of Homeland Security shows that the number of illegal aliens present in the United States has
nearly quadrupled in the past thirty years. The data estimates 10,990,000 were present in

Section 2:
2022. This number represents a material change in the illegal immigration environment that
existed when Plyler was decided; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that the sole focus of this act,
individuals who have "exhausted all available appeals" and are therefore subject to a valid final
order of removal, is a large population. At the end of fiscal year 2023, according to U.S.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Fiscal Year 2023 ICE Annual Report, 1,292,830 aliens
had "completed the legal process and ha[d] been ordered removed"; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that, unlike the statute at issue in
Plyler, because this act only applies to individuals "who[se] proceedings have been completed",
it is intended to "operate harmoniously within the federal program" of immigration enforcement;
and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that given the 1,292,830 individuals
who have been ordered removed by a final order, there no longer is an "inchoate federal
permission to remain" that was present in Plyler v. Doe; rather, these 1,292,830 final orders of
removal are a "fairly discernable" "national policy that supports the State in" implementing this
act; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee is best suited to determine the educational needs of its citizenry;
in fact, unlike the United States Constitution, the Tennessee Constitution in Article XI, Section
12 requires that the General Assembly "provide for the maintenance, support and eligibility
standards of a system of free public schools"; and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly seeks to fully effectuate its own constitutional
mandate in Article XI, Section 12 of the Tennessee Constitution to provide for the maintenance,
support, and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools by establishing an eligibility
standard for Tennessee public schools; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting and proper for the Tennessee General Assembly to fully exercise
its constitutional powers and duties in light of the exponential growth in the population of illegal
aliens in this State, and to utilize public funds for Tennessee citizens who are lawfully present in
the United States, and to remove the burden of providing a free publicly funded education for
illegal alien children from Tennessee taxpayers; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:

Section 3:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 49, Chapter 6, Part 30, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:
- 2 - 004412

provides documentation establishing that the student:
(i) Is a citizen of the United States;
(ii) Is in the process of obtaining citizenship; or
(iii) Holds a legal immigration or visa status.

(2) If a student or the parent or guardian of a student is unable to provide
documentation to establish that the student meets one (1) of the criteria in
subdivisions (a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii), and has exhausted all available appeals pursuant to
subsection (c), then the LEA or public charter school may elect not to enroll the
student without the student or the parent or guardian of the student paying tuition
as prescribed in this section. An LEA or public charter school is not required to
charge a student who does not meet one (1) of the criteria in subdivisions
(a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii) tuition in order to enroll in the LEA or public charter school. An
LEA or public charter school shall not refuse to enroll any such student in the
LEA or public charter school without first allowing the student to enroll upon

(b) Notwithstanding chapter 6 or 13 of this title to the contrary, each LEA and
public charter school that elects to enroll students upon payment of tuition who do not
meet one (1) of the criteria in subdivisions (a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii) shall annually establish a
- 3 - 004412

(c)
(1) If an LEA or public charter school determines that the documentation
provided by a student or a student's parent or guardian does not establish that
the student meets one (1) of the criteria in subdivisions (a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii) and that
the student is not eligible to enroll in the LEA or a public charter school without
paying tuition, then the LEA or public charter school may refuse to enroll the
student if tuition is not paid. The LEA or public charter school shall immediately
notify the student or the student's parent or guardian in writing of its decision and
of the student's or the parent's or guardian's right to appeal the LEA's or public
charter school's decision to the department of education no later than twenty-one
(21) days from the date of the LEA's or public charter school's decision.
(2)
(A) The student or the parent or guardian of a student who is
being denied enrollment without first paying tuition pursuant to this
subsection (c) may appeal the LEA's or public charter school's decision to
the department no later than twenty-one (21) days from the date of the
LEA's or public charter school's decision.
(B) The party who files an appeal with the department is entitled
to an expedited hearing before the department and bears the burden of
- 4 - 004412
proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the student meets one

not be denied enrollment, even without first paying tuition, during the
twenty-one-day window for appealing the LEA's or public charter school's
decision or during the appeal proceedings before the department. If the
student is enrolled in an LEA or public charter school during either of
those times, then the LEA or public charter school shall not remove the
student from school during either of those times.
(D) If the department determines on appeal that the student does
not meet one (1) of the criteria in subdivisions (a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii), then the
department shall notify the student, or the student's parent or guardian,
and the LEA or public charter school of its determination.
(3) If the student or the student's parent or guardian does not appeal the
LEA's or public charter school's decision that the student does not meet one (1)
of the criteria in subdivisions (a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii), or if the department determines on
appeal that the student does not meet one (1) of the criteria in subdivisions
(a)(1)(A)(i)-(iii), then:
(A) The LEA or public charter school may condition the student's
enrollment or continued enrollment in the LEA or public charter school on
the payment of tuition by the student or the student's parent or guardian.
Tuition must be determined pursuant to subsection (b) and may be
prorated based on the number of days the student will be enrolled, if
enrollment is not for a full school year; or
(B) If the student is enrolled in the LEA or public charter school
when the student's twenty-one-day appeal period expires or when the
department's determination on appeal is issued, and if the LEA or public
- 5 - 004412
charter school requires payment of tuition for the student's enrollment,
then the LEA or public charter school may remove the student from
school, but only for nonpayment of tuition.
(d) Notwithstanding title 10, chapter 7, all records relating to the legality of a
student's presence in the United States and all correspondence between an LEA or
public charter school and the department for purposes of this section are confidential
records.
