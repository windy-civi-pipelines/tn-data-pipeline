by deleting all language after the caption and substituting instead the following:
WHEREAS, in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), the United States Supreme Court
held that illegal alien children living in the United States could not be excluded from a free public
education based upon their immigration status; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that both the volume of illegal
immigration, and its commensurate drain on State resources, as well as federal immigration
policy have materially changed since 1982, when Plyler was decided; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that data from the U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service, Office of Policy and Planning, Estimates of the Unauthorized
Immigrant Population Residing in the United States: 1990 to 2000, shows the "many States . . .
had relatively few unauthorized residents" when Plyler was decided, but have subsequently
"experienced rapid growth of the unauthorized population"; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that data from the U.S. Department
of Homeland Security shows that the number of illegal aliens present in the United States has
nearly quadrupled in the past thirty years. The data estimates 10,990,000 were present in
2022. This number represents a material change in the illegal immigration environment that
existed when Plyler was decided; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that the sole focus of this act,
individuals who have "exhausted all available appeals" and are therefore subject to a valid final
order of removal, is a large population. At the end of fiscal year 2023, according to U.S.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Fiscal Year 2023 ICE Annual Report, 1,292,830 aliens
had "completed the legal process and ha[d] been ordered removed"; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that, unlike the statute at issue in
Plyler, because this act only applies to individuals "who[se] proceedings have been completed",
it is intended to "operate harmoniously within the federal program" of immigration enforcement;
and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee General Assembly finds that given the 1,292,830 individuals
who have been ordered removed by a final order, there no longer is an "inchoate federal
permission to remain" that was present in Plyler v. Doe; rather, these 1,292,830 final orders of
removal are a "fairly discernable" "national policy that supports the State in" implementing this
act; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee is best suited to determine the educational needs of its citizenry;
in fact, unlike the United States Constitution, the Tennessee Constitution in Article XI, Section
12 requires that the General Assembly "provide for the maintenance, support and eligibility
standards of a system of free public schools"; and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly seeks to fully effectuate its own constitutional
mandate in Article XI, Section 12 of the Tennessee Constitution to provide for the maintenance,
support, and eligibility standards of a system of free public schools by establishing an eligibility
standard for Tennessee public schools; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting and proper for the Tennessee General Assembly to fully exercise
its constitutional powers and duties in light of the exponential growth in the population of illegal
aliens in this State, to utilize public funds for Tennessee citizens who are lawfully present in the
United States, and to remove the burden of providing a free publicly funded education for illegal
alien children from Tennessee taxpayers; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 49, Chapter 6, Part 30, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:
- 2 - 005269

(a) Notwithstanding another law to the contrary:

(iii) Holds a legal immigration or visa status;
(B) Enroll students without requiring the production of
documentation described in subdivision (a)(1)(A);
(C) Condition the enrollment of students on the production of
documentation described in subdivision (a)(1)(A), regardless of whether
the documentation produced establishes that a student meets, or fails to
meet, one (1) of the criteria in subdivision (a)(1)(A);
(D) Condition the enrollment of a student who does not produce
the documentation described in subdivision (a)(1)(A), as required by the

payment of tuition in accordance with this section; or

documentation described in subdivision (a)(1)(A), as required by the LEA

having to offer the student the option of enrolling in the LEA or public
charter school if the student pays tuition; and
(2) If an LEA or public charter school conditions on payment of tuition, or
elects to deny altogether, a student's enrollment in the LEA or public charter
- 3 - 005269

school pursuant to subdivision (a)(1)(D) or (a)(1)(E) based on a determination
made by the LEA or public charter school that the documentation produced for
the student does not establish that the student meets one (1) of the criteria in
subdivision (a)(1)(A), then, notwithstanding this section to the contrary, the LEA
or public charter school shall enroll the student without requiring payment of
tuition, if applicable, during the twenty-one-day window for appealing the
determination pursuant to subdivision (c)(1) and during any appeal proceedings
initiated by or on behalf of the student with the department of education pursuant
to subdivision (c)(1). Once the twenty-one day period expires without an appeal
being filed, or at the conclusion of the appeal proceedings, the LEA or public
charter school may take the action authorized in this section with regard to the
student's enrollment school based on the department's determination on appeal.
(b) Notwithstanding chapter 6 or 13 of this title to the contrary, each LEA and
public charter school that elects to condition a student's enrollment in the LEA or public
charter school on payment of tuition pursuant to subdivision (a)(1)(D) shall annually
establish a uniform tuition amount for such students. Except as otherwise provided in
this section, the uniform tuition amount must:
(1) Be no less than the base funding amount, as defined in ยง 49-3-
104(2), for the respective school year;
(2) Not exceed the total average per pupil funding amount for the LEA for
the respective school year; and

(c) If an LEA or public charter school determines that the documentation
produced for a student does not establish that the student meets one (1) of the criteria in
subdivision (a)(1)(A), and the LEA or public charter school has elected to condition on
payment of tuition, or to deny altogether, the student's enrollment in the LEA or public
charter school, then:
- 4 - 005269

(1) The LEA or public charter school shall immediately notify the student
or the student's parent or guardian in a dated writing of the:
(A) Determination made by the LEA or public charter school
regarding the documentation produced for the student;
(B) Enrollment decision for the student; and
(C) Opportunity to appeal the determination made by the LEA or

required in subdivision (c)(1);
(3) The student, parent, or guardian who files an appeal with the
department pursuant to this subsection (c) is entitled to an expedited hearing
before the department and bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the student meets one (1) of the criteria in subdivision (a)(1)(A);
(4) If the department determines on appeal that the student does not
meet one (1) of the criteria in subdivision (a)(1)(A), then the department shall
notify the student, or the student's parent or guardian, and the LEA or public
charter school of its determination; and
(5) If the student or the student's parent or guardian does not timely
appeal the determination made by the LEA or public charter school regarding the
documentation produced for the student to the department, or if the department
- 5 - 005269

determines on appeal that the student does not meet one (1) of the criteria in
subdivision (a)(1)(A), then:
(A) The LEA or public charter school may condition the student's
enrollment or continued enrollment in the LEA or public charter school on
payment of tuition. Tuition must be determined pursuant to subsection (b)
and may be prorated by the LEA or public charter school based on the
number of days the student is enrolled, if enrollment is for less than a full
school year; or
(B) The LEA or public charter school may deny the student's
enrollment or continued enrollment in the LEA or public charter school
and may remove the student from a public school managed and
controlled by the LEA's local board of education or from the public charter
school, as applicable.
(d) Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, each LEA and public charter
school shall document the number of students who enroll in the LEA or public charter

The department shall report the information received from each LEA and public charter
school pursuant to this subsection (d) for the immediately preceding school year to the
speakers of the house of representatives and the senate by July 1 each year.

all compulsory school attendance and truancy intervention laws and requirements.
(f) Notwithstanding title 10, chapter 7, all records relating to the legality of a
student's presence in the United States and all correspondence between an LEA or
- 6 - 005269

public charter school and the department of education for purposes of this section are
confidential records.
SECTION 2. The state board of education shall promulgate rules, including emergency
rules, to effectuate this act. The rules must, at a minimum, establish the appeal process
required in this act, and must be promulgated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative
Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5.
SECTION 3. This act takes effect July 1, 2025, the public welfare requiring it, and
applies to the 2025-2026 school year and subsequent school years.
