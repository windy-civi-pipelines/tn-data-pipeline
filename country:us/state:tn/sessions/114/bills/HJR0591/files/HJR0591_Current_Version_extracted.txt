Subdivision, and his sixteen tackles for loss ranked top fifteen nationally; and
WHEREAS, the members of the University of Memphis Tigers have truly distinguished
themselves as gridiron greats, and they are richly deserving of our approbation; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
