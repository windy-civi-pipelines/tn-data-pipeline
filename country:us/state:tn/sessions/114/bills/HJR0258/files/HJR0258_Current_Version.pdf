HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 258
By Hemmer
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Natalie Williams on
her selection as the Metro Nashville Public
Schools Elementary Teacher of the Year.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should pause to specially recognize those outstanding
teachers who have devoted their careers to providing the highest quality education for
Tennessee's students; and
WHEREAS, Natalie Williams is one such estimable educator, who has distinguished
herself as a professional of the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity; and
WHEREAS, a teacher at Percy Priest Elementary School, Mrs. Williams has recently
been named the Metro Nashville Public Schools Elementary Teacher of the Year, a most
befitting honor that recognizes the positive influence she has on so many young lives; and
WHEREAS, due to her father's occupation, Mrs. Williams changed schools frequently as
a child, even studying for some time in Belgium, and her unique experience of traveling and
displacement gives her a particular insight into various styles of education and the personal
experience of those students who experience similar situations of instability; and
WHEREAS, familiar with both roles in the classroom, Mrs. Williams just recently
acquired her education specialist degree in culture, cognition, and the learning process in order
to gain greater awareness of student identity and its proper integration into the classroom, and
she is pursuing a Doctor of Education degree in Higher Education to further widen her cross-
curricular perspective; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Williams began her teaching career in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and she
moved to Nashville in 2015, first becoming part of the founding team at Waverly-Belmont
Elementary School and then stepping into her current position at Percy Priest Elementary; and

citizens; and

and her friendship and counsel are highly valued by those who are fortunate to know her; and
WHEREAS, Natalie Williams truly epitomizes the dedicated teacher who is wholly
committed to the highest ideals of public service and quality education for all, and she should be
specially recognized; now, therefore,
