Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 576
By Jones J
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Maya Turner for her
outstanding contributions to the arts.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should recognize
those gifted artists whose work enriches our communities, fosters cultural understanding, and
reflects the depth of the human experience; and
WHEREAS, one such remarkable individual is Maya Turner, a self-taught artist whose
work in wood carving celebrates both her personal journey and the vibrant cultures that inspire
her; and
WHEREAS, a practicing artist for more than two decades, Ms. Turner employs a
handheld gouge to create intricate carvings of people, animals, and abstract forms in wood,
which she then paints in vivid, bold colors that accentuate the richness and beauty of often-
overlooked cultures; and
WHEREAS, Maya Turner's art is deeply personal and evocative; as an individual living
with epilepsy, she draws from her lived experience, expressing through her work the cycles and
changes that occur after a seizure—offering viewers a window into both the complexity of the
human brain and the resilience of the human spirit; and
WHEREAS, her work has been featured in art festivals and exhibitions across the
nation, including the Tennessee Craft Fair, 100 Taylor Arts Market, the William Edmondson Arts
and Culture Fest, Artclectic, the Essence Festival of Culture, SOKO Market, and the Black Girl
Art Show in Brooklyn; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Turner's artistic vision—marked by bold lines, vibrant palettes, and
cultural reverence—not only beautifies the spaces it inhabits but also uplifts stories and
traditions too often marginalized in the broader art world; and
