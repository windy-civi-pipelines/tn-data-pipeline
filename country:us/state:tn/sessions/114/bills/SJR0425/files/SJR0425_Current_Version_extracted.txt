A RESOLUTION to honor Greg O'Connor, 2025 Community
Volunteer recipient of the John J. Duncan Sr.

WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should salute those
citizens who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as community
leaders of whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such individual is Greg O'Connor of Knoxville, who was recently named
the 2025 Community Volunteer recipient of the John J. Duncan Sr. Award for Senior Advocacy;
and
WHEREAS, the John J. Duncan Sr. Award for Senior Advocacy was created to honor
those who steadfastly work to improve the lives of seniors in the Knoxville community, as the
award's namesake did throughout his career; recipients are professionals and community
members who have been nominated in recognition of their tireless efforts on behalf of seniors;
and
WHEREAS, Greg O'Connor has made a significant impact on the Knoxville community
over the years; although he practiced law for fifty-one years, his influence goes well beyond the
legal field, reaching into the lives of countless individuals through his work with local
organizations and charitable causes; and
WHEREAS, for twenty-five years, Greg O'Connor was an active and influential figure at
the John T. O'Connor Senior Center, an organization dedicated to enriching the lives of seniors,
and he served on the board of the center for much of that time; and

Open golf tournament and the Pancake Breakfast, both of which have become beloved events
in Knoxville; and
WHEREAS, in the faith community, Mr. O'Connor played a pivotal role in Immaculate
Conception Church's Fish Program, which provides food and support to those in need; his
service to the program as a hands-on leader was a direct reflection of his belief in helping others
and his strong sense of social responsibility; and
WHEREAS, Mr. O'Connor devoted considerable time and energy to Family Promise, an
organization that helps families experiencing homelessness, and Justice Knox, which seeks to
address racial injustice and inequality in the Knoxville area; and
WHEREAS, his involvement in these organizations speaks volumes about his
commitment to making Knoxville a better place for everyone, particularly those who are most
vulnerable; and
WHEREAS, Greg O'Connor's lifelong dedication to service is a testament to the impact
one person can have on a community; he has left an indelible mark on Knoxville by acting on
his steadfast belief in the power of giving back; and
WHEREAS, as Knoxville continues to grow and evolve, the foundation that Mr. O'Connor
has helped build will remain a guiding light for future generations; his legacy exemplifies his
deeply rooted desire to make the world a better place; and
