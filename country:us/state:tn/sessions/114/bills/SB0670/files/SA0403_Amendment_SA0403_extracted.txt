(ii) Mitigation banking, then the report must include the mitigation
bank sponsor, the number of mitigation credits sold for the permitted

Section 3:
SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 69-3-108(r) is amended by
designating the existing language as subdivision (1) and designating the following as a new
subdivision (2):
(2)
(A) A person desiring to develop real property may request a
determination from the commissioner regarding the presence, extent, and
category of wetlands by submitting a wetland resource inventory report prepared
by a third-party wetland professional, including a delineation and, if applicable,
documentation that the wetland is isolated. The report must also include a
determination of the quality of the wetland. The wetland delineation portion of
the report must be prepared in accordance with the United States Army Corps of
Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual (January 1987) and applicable regional
supplements or other such methodology contained in rules promulgated by the
board.
(B) If the wetland resource inventory report contains all required
information, is prepared in accordance with department procedures and
guidance, and is certified by a third-party wetland professional to be true,
accurate and complete, then the determinations made in the wetland resource
inventory report are presumed to be correct unless the commissioner notifies the
person, in writing, within thirty (30) days of submittal of the report containing ten
(10) or fewer wetlands, or within sixty (60) days of submittal of the report
containing more than ten (10) wetlands, that the commissioner has affirmatively
determined there is a significant question about the presence, extent, status as
- 2 - 006502
isolated, or quality of a wetland and states the reasons for that determination. If
such a determination is made, then the commissioner must, within thirty (30)
days following the initial notification, determine the presence, extent, status as
isolated, and quality of wetlands, and notify the person in writing of that decision
and the reasons for the determination.
(C) The person on whose behalf a wetland resource inventory report was
submitted may appeal a determination by the commissioner by filing a petition
stating the basis for the appeal with the board within thirty (30) days of receiving
the commissioner's decision.
SECTON 3. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 69, Chapter 3, Part 1, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:
(a) As used in this section:
(1) "Artificial isolated wetland":
(A) Means:
(i) A wetland formed in an area that would otherwise be
upland as a result of prior human alterations such as drainage, fill,
cropping, ditching, tile drainage, excavation, tire ruts, silviculture,
or impoundment for which sufficient proof exists providing
evidence that a wetland did not exist five (5) years prior to the
submission of a wetland resource inventory report; or
(ii) A wetland that was intentionally constructed in an
upland area for the purpose of wastewater treatment, stormwater
management, or other engineered use, or was inadvertently
created due to changes in surface hydrology from site
development, and grading or as a result of a beaver dam within
the five (5) years prior to the submission of a wetland resource
inventory report; and
- 3 - 006502
(B) Does not include wetlands that serve as fish spawning areas
or wetlands created as a result of mitigation requirements;
(2) "High-quality isolated wetland" means an isolated wetland that
provides a high degree of ecologic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical functions, as
measured by the department’s wetland resource assessment tool;
(3) "Isolated wetland" means a wetland that does not have a continuous
surface connection to a relatively permanent body of water that is connected to a
traditional interstate navigable water and, as such, is distinguishable from that
body of water;
(4) "Low-quality isolated wetland" means an isolated wetland that
provides only minimal ecologic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical functions, as
measured by the department’s wetland resource assessment tool; and
(5) "Moderate-quality isolated wetland" means an isolated wetland that
provides only modest ecologic, hydrologic, and biogeochemical functions as
measured by the department’s wetland resource assessment tool.
(b) Notwithstanding another law or rule to the contrary:
(1) The alteration of a low-quality isolated wetland up to one (1) acre in
size, a moderate-quality isolated wetland up to one-quarter (1/4) acre in size, or
an artificial isolated wetland of any size is permitted by this subdivision (b)(1),
and notice, approval, or compensatory mitigation is not required for such
alteration if the alteration is done in accordance with the following conditions:
(A) The activity must not result in the discharge of toxic pollutants;
(B) Sediment must be prevented from entering a stream or other
surface waters; and
(C) Appropriate steps must be taken to ensure that petroleum
products or other chemical pollutants are prevented from entering waters
- 4 - 006502
of the state. In the event of a spill, measures must be taken immediately
to prevent pollution of waters of the state, including groundwater;
(2) The alteration of a low-quality isolated wetland that is greater than
one (1) acre up to two (2) acres in size, or a moderate-quality isolated wetland
that is greater than one-quarter (1/4) acre up to two (2) acres in size, must be
regulated by a general permit for aquatic alterations pursuant to § 69-3-108(l).
The general permit required by this subdivision (b)(2) must not impose any
requirements related to riparian buffer, cumulative impact analysis, or
antidegradation, within the scope of this part;
(3) Compensatory mitigation is not required for alteration of a wetland
subject to subdivision (b)(1) or (b)(2), except that mitigation may be required for:
(A) Alteration of a moderate-quality isolated wetland:
(i) For the acreage greater than one-quarter (1/4) acre up
to one (1) acre in size at a ratio not to exceed 1:1; and
(ii) For the acreage greater than one (1) acre up to two (2)
acres in size at a ratio not to exceed 2:1; and
(B) Alteration of a low-quality isolated wetland for the acreage
greater than one (1) acre up to two (2) acres in size at a ratio not to
exceed 1:1;
(4) Unless required by federal law and except as authorized by
subdivision (b)(3), additional permits, authorization, conditions, or requirements
related to cumulative impact analysis, antidegradation, or mitigation are not
required for activity within a wetland subject to subdivision (b)(1) or (b)(2).
Notwithstanding any requirement for reducing pollutants to the maximum extent
practicable, riparian buffers are not required for wetlands subject to subdivision
(b)(1) or (b)(2);
- 5 - 006502
(5) An individual aquatic resource alteration permit is required for
alteration of a low-quality isolated wetland or moderate-quality isolated wetland
greater than two (2) acres and a high-quality isolated wetland of any size; and
(6) The acreage requirements in this subsection (b) must be considered
minimum acreage limits. The commissioner is authorized to increase the
acreage of low-quality isolated wetlands and moderate-quality isolated wetlands
permitted by subdivision (b)(1) and the acreage of low-quality isolated wetlands
and moderate-quality isolated wetlands subject to subdivision (b)(2) as the
commissioner deems appropriate.
(c) Existing onsite permanent stormwater control measures must be accounted
for when determining the amount of mitigation required for alteration to any isolated
wetland where mitigation is required.
(d) Isolated wetlands and artificial isolated wetlands must not be considered
when determining the cumulative impact of a project for purposes of a permit even if the
project contains other wetlands that are deemed jurisdictional by the United States army
corps of engineers (USACE). A water quality certification under § 401 of the federal
Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1341) must not consider isolated or artificial isolated
wetlands when determining cumulative impact or common plan of development.
(e) The board has authority to develop criteria for the three (3) classifications of
isolated wetlands as duly promulgated rules.
(f) The wetland resource assessment tool established and utilized by the
department to measure the presence or quality of a wetland is subject to a public notice
and comment period of no less than thirty (30) days. The wetland resource assessment
tool must be approved by the board following the public notice and comment period.
