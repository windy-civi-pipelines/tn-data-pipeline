HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 25
By Clemmons
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Mark Moffatt of
Nashville.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly were greatly saddened to learn of
the passing of Mark Moffatt; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Moffatt was a renowned producer, guitarist, music businessman, and
mentor whose legacy will continue to inspire those in Music City and beyond; and
WHEREAS, hailing from Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, Mark Moffatt moved to
Brisbane, Australia, before relocating to the United Kingdom to work on London's Denmark
Street for several years; and
WHEREAS, after returning to Brisbane in 1976, he, at the age of only twenty-five, was
able to capture and craft the frenetic verve of the Australian punk band The Saints, producing
"(I'm) Stranded," a song that ignited the punk music scene; thus, far away from The Clash or the
Buzzcocks, Mark Moffatt harnessed a distinctly Australian brand of punk; and
WHEREAS, production stints with EMI and TCS Studios in Melbourne paved a way to
Sydney in 1980, where Moffatt joined Festival Records as in-house producer, working with
some of the biggest names in Australian music for more than a decade; throughout his career,
Mark Moffatt continued to produce Australian artists across genres, from Yothu Yindi, who
incorporated Aboriginal tradition with pop music, to New Wave artists such as Tim Finn; and
WHEREAS, upon moving to Nashville in 1996, he bridged the divide between Australia
and Music City, mentoring his fellow Aussie Keith Urban and helping develop his career; and
WHEREAS, through the Australian performing rights organization APRA AMCOS, he
helped Australian artists license and distribute their music in Nashville; he served as the
organization's inaugural Nashville member relations representative until his retirement in June

Achievement Award; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Moffatt was a founding member of the now-renowned Americana Music
Association; he produced fifteen Australian Recording Industry Association Hall of Fame
inductees and was behind more tracks than any other single producer in APRA AMCOS's list of
the Top 30 Australian songs, published in 2001; and
WHEREAS, a true music man to the end, Mr. Moffatt was putting the finishing touches
on an album for KILO, a band he formed with Australian singer John "Swanee" Swan, at the
time of his passing; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his passion and devotion to music, Mark Moffatt was deeply
committed to his family, most especially his wife, Lindsey; stepdaughter, Dana; son, Geordie;
and two granddaughters; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Moffatt leaves behind an indelible legacy and a rich catalog that will
forever remain touchstones of American and Australian music; and

remember the bountiful life of this exceptional public servant and human being; now, therefore,
