A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Dustin Helton on his
selection as the 2024-2025 Sevier County
School System Grades 9-12 Teacher of the

WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause to
specially recognize those outstanding teachers who have devoted their careers to providing the
highest quality education for Tennessee's students; and
WHEREAS, Dustin Helton is one such estimable educator, who has distinguished
himself as a professional of the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Helton has been selected as the 2024-2025 Sevier County School
System Grades 9-12 Teacher of the Year, a most befitting honor that recognizes the positive
influence he has on so many young lives; and
WHEREAS, in his ninth year as a social studies teacher at Pigeon Forge High School,
Dustin Helton has served with acumen and alacrity as a teacher for ten years; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Helton is an extremely talented and compassionate educator who works
assiduously to motivate his students to reach their full potential, both as scholars and as
citizens; and
WHEREAS, one of Dustin Helton's most impactful initiatives as a teacher is his
challenge to each semester's U.S. Government and Civics students to create impactful and
sustainable school improvement projects; and
WHEREAS, another way in which he brings learning to life is by connecting students
with prominent community individuals at the local, state, and national levels; over the years, he
has invited local political party leaders to come and discuss their role within the larger party
agenda, including former Governor Don Sundquist, Secretary of State Tre Hargett, former State
Representative Dale Carr, and former State Senator Doug Overbey, to speak about their public
service experience; and
