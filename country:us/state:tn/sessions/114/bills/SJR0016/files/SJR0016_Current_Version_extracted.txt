Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 16
By Kyle
A RESOLUTION to urge Tennesseans to contribute or donate
feminine hygiene products to local schools.
WHEREAS, in the United States, nearly one in four students lacks access to feminine
hygiene products; and
WHEREAS, without access to appropriate feminine hygiene products, students are more
likely to miss school; increased student absenteeism leads to lower academic performance and
increased vulnerability to dropping out of school; and
WHEREAS, lower-income students and students of color are more impacted by lack of
access to feminine hygiene products than white and middle-income students; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we encourage the good people of the State of
Tennessee to contribute or donate feminine hygiene products to their local schools.
