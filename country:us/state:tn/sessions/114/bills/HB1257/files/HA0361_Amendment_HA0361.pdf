(c)
(1) The Tennessee bureau of investigation (TBI) shall develop a request
for certification form to be completed by the court and submitted to the TBI prior
to entering an order of expunction. The court is not required to submit a
certificate to the TBI if the expungement is pursuant to § 40-32-109 or § 40-32-
106, unless the expunction was the result of the successful completion of a
pretrial diversion program, pursuant to §§ 40-15-102 – 40-15-107 or judicial
diversion program pursuant to § 40-35-313. The certificate must contain the
name of the person seeking expunction, the person's date of birth and social
- 29 - 006382

security number, the offense that the person is seeking to have expunged, the
date of arrest, and the appropriate state control number as referenced in § 8-4-
115. The TBI shall provide access to the certificate to each clerk that accepts
petitions for expunction.
(2) After receiving a request for certification, the TBI shall determine if the
submitted offense is eligible for expunction pursuant to § 40-32-107 or § 40-32-
105 and note the determination on the certificate. The TBI shall provide the court
with a copy of the certificate containing the determination, or an explanation why
a determination cannot be reached. The certificate may also be distributed to the
district attorney and the defendant or the defendant's attorney.
(3) An order of expunction must not be entered by the court unless a
certificate, as required by this subsection (c), is attached to the order of
expunction.
(4) The certificate provided by the TBI pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) is
only a certification as to whether the submitted offense is eligible for expunction.
The certification is not a certification that the defendant is eligible for expunction,
and the court continues to have the duty to determine eligibility. The TBI is not
required to search any other source or database in order to make the certification
required by this subsection (c).
(d) A court ordering the expunction of a person's public records of a criminal
offense pursuant to this chapter shall send or cause to be sent a copy of the expunction
order to the Tennessee bureau of investigation within thirty (30) days from the date of
the expunction order for entry into its expunged offender and pretrial diversion database.
The order must contain the name of the person seeking expunction, the person's date of
birth and social security number, the offense that was dismissed, the appropriate state
control number as referenced in § 8-4-115, the date and cause of the dismissal, and the
date the order of expunction is entered.
