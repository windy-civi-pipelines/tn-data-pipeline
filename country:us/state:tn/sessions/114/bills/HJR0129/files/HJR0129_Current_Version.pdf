HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 129
By Mitchell
A RESOLUTION to urge Mark Goins to resign as Tennessee
Coordinator of Elections.
WHEREAS, the United States Election Assistance Commission Standards Board (EAC),
under the leadership of Chairman Mark Goins, has a duty to uphold the integrity of the electoral
process and to ensure fairness and transparency; and
WHEREAS, recent events have revealed significant lapses in oversight, including the
validation of a petition to run for office that contained fraudulent signatures, compromising public
trust; and
WHEREAS, on May 2, 2024, a candidate and her supporters publicly admitted to forging
signatures on their petition to run for office, further evidencing a failure in the verification
process witnessed by Chairman Mark Goins; and
WHEREAS, these actions undermine confidence in the electoral system and fail to
uphold the standards of accountability required for the role of Chairman of the EAC and the
Tennessee Coordinator of Elections; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that the General Assembly urges Mark Goins to resign as Tennessee
Coordinator of Elections, to restore public trust and reinforce the integrity of the electoral
process.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
with this final clause omitted from such copy and transmitted to the Secretary of State.
