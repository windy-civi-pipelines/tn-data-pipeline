HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 628

A RESOLUTION to recognize Paul Thompson on the occasion of
his retirement.
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we should honor those citizens who have performed
with uncommon devotion and enthusiasm throughout their years of industry; and
WHEREAS, one such estimable person is Paul Thompson, who recently took his much-
deserved retirement after nearly three decades with Tri-County Electric, having been the
longest-serving CEO in Tri-County Electric history and the longest-serving active CEO in
Tennessee at the time of his retirement; and
WHEREAS, a graduate of Macon County High School, Mr. Thompson received his
Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Tennessee Technological University; and
WHEREAS, his illustrious career with Tri-County Electric began in March 1998, when he
was named Director of Marketing, in which capacity he served until February 2001, when he
was named interim CEO; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Thompson was named CEO of Tri-County Electric in May 2001, and,
under his leadership, Tri-County Electric became the first electric cooperative in Kentucky or
Tennessee to install automated metering, allowing the cooperative to implement an outage
management system that significantly decreased outage times and allowed it to be among the
first cooperatives in the country to provide pre-paid metering; and
WHEREAS, his tenure also saw the installation of a NOAA Weather Radio Warning
System for Macon County, which led to Tri-County Electric being awarded the Mark Trail Award
in 2004, an honor bestowed on those who have made significant contributions to the
advancement of weather technology; and
