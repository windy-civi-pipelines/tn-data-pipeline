WHEREAS, additional treatments, vocational counseling, and rehabilitation therapies
exist that have been clinically proven to mitigate symptoms and improve recovery when used
alone or integrated with counseling. Additional therapies to treat traumatic brain injuries and
post-traumatic stress disorder include physical therapy, occupational therapy, cognitive therapy,
speech therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy; and
WHEREAS, hyperbaric oxygen therapy couples hyperbaric oxygen chamber treatment,
which promotes oxygen for healing and restoring injured brain tissue, together with counseling;
and
WHEREAS, access to a variety of treatments improves a veteran's opportunities for
healing and recovery; and
WHEREAS, the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act (2023 H.R. 3649)
would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a pilot program to furnish hyperbaric
oxygen therapy to veterans suffering from traumatic brain injury or post-traumatic stress
disorder; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we strongly urge the United States Congress to swiftly enact legislation to
provide for veterans' access to treatments for traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress
disorder that include hyperbaric oxygen therapy, such as the Veterans' National Traumatic
Injury Treatment Act, and any other legislation improving or authorizing access to other
important therapies and counseling, and legislation fostering research and development of
additional therapies.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this resolution be transmitted to
the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the President and the

Secretary of the United States Senate, and each member of the Tennessee Congressional
delegation.
