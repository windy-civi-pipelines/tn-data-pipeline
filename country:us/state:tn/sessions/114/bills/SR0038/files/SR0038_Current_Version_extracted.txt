Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 38
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Kevin Whalum of
Memphis.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those citizens who, through their
extraordinary efforts and artistic contributions, have distinguished themselves as community
leaders of whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy person is Kevin Whalum of Memphis, an exceptional
vocalist in the soul, jazz, scat, and gospel genres; and
WHEREAS, Kevin Whalum hails from the highly respected Whalum family of Memphis,
the members of which, over four generations, have distinguished themselves time and again in
the fields of music, worship, and public service; and
WHEREAS, Kevin Whalum grew up in Memphis, where he attended Olivet Fellowship
Baptist Church, led by his father; the church, known for its singers and musicians, created both
a religious and a musical foundation for a young Kevin Whalum; and
WHEREAS, following his graduation from Morehouse College, Mr. Whalum moved to
Chicago, Illinois, where he worked a sales job during the day and played with the band Fast
Forward in the evenings; and
WHEREAS, Kevin Whalum moved to Nashville and appeared as a guest vocalist on his
brother's 1997 release, The Gospel According to Jazz, Chapter 1, and as a part of his band at
that year's Stellar Awards; and
WHEREAS, two years later, Mr. Whalum went into the music industry full time and
became a popular live and session vocalist in Nashville's soul music scene; and

WHEREAS, Kevin Whalum's extensive artistic journey led to his project Timetable; the
independent album explored multiple genres while simultaneously introducing his musical
aptitude to his audience and showcasing his love for faith, family, and music; and
WHEREAS, for several years, Mr. Whalum dedicated his time and talents as a
background singer before returning to the studio with producers George Duke and Rex Rideout,
among others, and releasing One Life to Love in 2008; and
WHEREAS, his professional accomplishments aside, Kevin Whalum enjoys the love and
support of his wife, Camille, whom he married in 1996; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Whalum epitomizes the spirit and commitment that are characteristic of
a true Tennessean; and
WHEREAS, it is most fitting that the members of this legislative body should pause to
honor Kevin Whalum's commitment to excellence in faith, musical artistry, and family; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor and commend Kevin
Whalum for his indelible contributions to the music industry and extend to him our best wishes
for continued success.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.
