SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 437
By Harshbarger
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Wendy Doran upon her
receipt of the Lifesaving Award from the Sullivan
County Sheriff's Office.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly recognize those
Tennesseans who, without hesitation, act to protect the lives of others; and
WHEREAS, one such individual is Sullivan County 911 dispatcher Wendy Doran, who
has been duly honored with the Lifesaving Award by the Sullivan County Sheriff's Office, a
recognition rarely given but well deserved, for a recent act of heroism; and
WHEREAS, on December 19, 2024, while on duty, Ms. Doran responded to a call from a
frantic father, whose infant had been found unresponsive in the bathtub; without hesitation, she
sprang into action and offered lifesaving instructions over the phone; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Doran used a new technology, Rapid Deploy, which sent a link directly
to the father's phone and allowed her to see the baby's condition in real time; she told him to
use a bulb syringe to clear water from the infant's mouth, restoring the baby's ability to breathe
until emergency medical services arrived shortly afterward; and
WHEREAS, Wendy Doran is a dispatcher of immense merit and skill, whose quick
thinking and active empathy helped save one of our youngest Tennesseans during a medical
emergency, and it is wholly fitting that she be honored; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor and commend Wendy Doran upon her
receipt of the Lifesaving Award from the Sullivan County Sheriff's Office, extending our sincere
gratitude for her ceaseless service to the State of Tennessee.
