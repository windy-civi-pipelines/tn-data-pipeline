people of the 18th House District during his six-year tenure as a member of the Tennessee

service as chair of the House Government Operations Committee and a member of the House
Judiciary, Insurance, State Government, and Business and Utilities committees; and

bringing to his office the conservative values of hard work and common sense; and
WHEREAS, after earning a Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Memphis, Mr.

venture into outdoor advertising; and
WHEREAS, Martin Daniel is wholly committed to the noble precepts of public service
and political engagement that have earned Tennessee recognition as the Volunteer State, and
