WHEREAS, Dave Staley's exemplary tenure as a broadcaster spans more than four
decades and includes coverage of numerous major sporting events, including Super Bowls and
World Series; and

eventually relocated to Chattanooga, where he spent thirty-seven years at NewsChannel 9; he
concluded his career at WDEF, where he still occasionally fills in today; and

known for his creation of Dave's Diamond Darlings, a local television favorite that humorously
captured the antics of Little League baseball; and

years and earned him multiple awards, including three MidSouth Emmys and three Edward R.
Murrow National Awards; and
