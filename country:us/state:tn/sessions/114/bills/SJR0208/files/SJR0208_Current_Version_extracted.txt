SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 208
By Johnson
A RESOLUTION to recognize Benjamin Barry on becoming an
Eagle Scout.

of America is one of our finest assets, providing young people with an educational program that
contributes significantly to their character development, citizenship training, and improved
mental and physical fitness; and
WHEREAS, the highest rank a Boy Scout can attain in the Boy Scouts of America
Scouts BSA program is that of Eagle Scout, and Benjamin "Benji" Barry, after considerable
effort and diligent preparation, will join the prestigious Eagle Court of Honor; and
WHEREAS, Benji's remarkable future success was already signaled during his time in
the Cub Scouts, when he earned the Arrow of Light; and
WHEREAS, his notable record of achievement as a member of Boy Scout Troop 16
includes forty-two merit badges and distinguished service, culminating in the 176 volunteer
hours required for his Eagle project, and he excelled as a leader among his peers during his
performance as Patrol Leader, Scribe, and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader; and
WHEREAS, Benji's Eagle project, the construction of "Reagan's Rainbow Memorial
Bridge" for deceased pets at the Williamson County Animal Center, greatly contributed to the
betterment of his community and reflected the true spirit of volunteerism; and
WHEREAS, Benji's accolades also include three religious awards, including the highest
award in Catholic Scouting, an accomplishment that required a year of work to achieve; and
WHEREAS, apart from his Scouting endeavors, Benji is an industrious sophomore at
Brentwood Academy, where he is on the Headmaster's Academic Roll, serves as a student
ambassador, and plays both football and baseball; and
