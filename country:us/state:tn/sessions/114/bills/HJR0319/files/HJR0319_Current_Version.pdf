HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 319
By Reeves
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Mark Burns on
winning his fifth martial arts world title.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly take great pleasure in recognizing a
gentleman who has attained the very acme of martial arts competition while serving a higher
purpose in his community; and
WHEREAS, Mark Burns had won four ATA Martial Arts world titles, the last in 2010,
before retiring from competition; and
WHEREAS, in 2024, which marked ATA's fifty-fifth anniversary, Mr. Burns returned to
competitive martial arts and won his fifth ATA world title in creative forms, an incredible
accomplishment considering that he had undergone hip replacements in the interim; and
WHEREAS, in the previous year, Mark Burns and his wife, Ariana, had taken a leap of
faith and opened their own martial arts school, Honor Martial Arts, so named to honor God; and
WHEREAS, through Mr. Burns's deft guidance, Honor Martial Arts seeks to develop
leaders, strengthen families, and build a community grounded in faith, character, and
perseverance, in addition to teaching martial arts; and
WHEREAS, Honor Martial Arts focuses on faith-based values, personal growth, and
serving others and utilizes martial arts as a tool to build confidence, discipline, and resilience
that extends far beyond competition and self-defense; and
WHEREAS, Mark Burns discovered his enduring passion for martial arts in 1989, when
at the age of nine, he began practicing taekwondo at a school located in the basement of a
Chinese restaurant in Elkhart, Indiana; and
WHEREAS, he opened his first martial arts school in 2000 in Kalamazoo, Michigan; after
nearly a decade there, he took a break to refocus, before eventually joining Karate Atlanta,

where he spent the next ten years developing schools, training students, and growing as an
instructor and leader; and
WHEREAS, in December 2016, Mr. Burns was experiencing a difficult time in his life and
felt truly lost; from these depths of despair, he found the promise and solace of Christianity and
accepted Jesus as his Lord and Savior; and
WHEREAS, as he began to find true purpose in his life through his relationship with
God, Mark Burns was blessed to meet his future wife; battling through the COVID pandemic
together, Mark and Ariana were married in September 2020 and welcomed their son Micah into
the world in August 2021; and
WHEREAS, Mark and Ariana Burns and Honor Martial Arts are nurturing our future
leaders by teaching them time-honored values in addition to martial arts; and
WHEREAS, this martial arts world champion is most deserving of our approbation; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and congratulate Mark Burns on winning his fifth ATA Martial
Arts world title in creative forms, thank him for his ongoing commitment to positively influencing
and directing his students' lives, and extend to him our best wishes for much continued success
and happiness in the future.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
