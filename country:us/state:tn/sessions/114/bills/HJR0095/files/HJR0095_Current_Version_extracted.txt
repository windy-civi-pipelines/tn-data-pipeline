Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 95
By Reedy
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Joyce Gregory.
WHEREAS, the long and distinguished history of pupil transportation includes many
episodes of dedicated service by school bus drivers, who daily serve and protect the children
under their charge in ways both great and small; and
WHEREAS, school bus drivers are truly real-life heroes; unfortunately, Joyce Gregory, a
Stewart County school bus driver, lost her life while discharging her duties some twenty years
ago; and
WHEREAS, on March 3, 2005, Joyce Gregory was engaged in her usual task of picking
up students and transporting them to Dover Elementary School and Stewart County High
School when tragedy struck on a rural road just outside Cumberland City; and
WHEREAS, as she stopped the bus to pick up students, a fourteen-year-old male with a
personal vendetta against the bus driver fatally shot Ms. Gregory; thankfully, none of the twenty-
four students already on the bus were injured; and
WHEREAS, some twenty years later, we faithfully remember Ms. Gregory's courage and
commitment in the face of death, as do the loved ones who cherish her memory; and
WHEREAS, she gave her life while providing a means for the children under her charge
to receive a quality education and achieve a brighter future; and
WHEREAS, we are eternally grateful to Joyce Gregory for her ultimate sacrifice in
advancing the cause of education as a role model and positive influence for children, and her
bountiful life should be commemorated; now, therefore,
