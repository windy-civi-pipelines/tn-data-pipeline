HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 358
By Russell
A RESOLUTION to honor the commemoration of National
Glioblastoma Cancer Awareness Day in
Tennessee.
WHEREAS, the third Wednesday in July is annually observed as National Glioblastoma
Cancer Awareness Day; and
WHEREAS, glioblastoma is one of the most common and highly invasive malignant
brain neoplasms, with an incidence of two to three new cases per 100,000 people per year
worldwide; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, primary malignant brain tumors are rare and account
for two percent of all adult cancers; and
WHEREAS, despite their rarity, brain cancer incidence has increased over the last thirty
years while survival rates remain extremely poor; and
WHEREAS, due to glioblastoma's aggressiveness, the median survival time for a newly
diagnosed patient is approximately one year, with less than five percent of patients surviving
five years post diagnosis; and
WHEREAS, in Tennessee, the rate of brain and nervous system cancers is 6.2 new
cases per 100,000 per year, and the rate of death in brain and nervous system cancers is 4.8
per 100,000; and
WHEREAS, on National Glioblastoma Cancer Awareness Day in Tennessee, individuals
living with glioblastoma, their families, advocates, and dedicated organizations throughout our
State will join together to increase public awareness of glioblastoma, support research, honor all
those we have lost, and embrace hope for improved screening methods, treatments, and a
cure; now, therefore,
