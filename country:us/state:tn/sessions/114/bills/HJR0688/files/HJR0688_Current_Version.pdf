WHEREAS, sadly, these four fine young people were denied the opportunity to live and
excel as contributing members of our society, and it is fitting that we express our respect and
sorrow at the passing of Akilah Dasilva, DeEbony Groves, Joe Perez, and Taurean Sanderlin
who live on in the hearts and minds of their family, friends, and fellow Nashvillians; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that, on the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the Waffle House Shooting
on April 22, 2018, we honor the memories of Akilah Dasilva, DeEbony Groves, Joe Perez, and
Taurean Sanderlin, four beloved members of the Nashville community who were taken from us
too soon.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
