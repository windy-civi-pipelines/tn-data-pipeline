(2) An LEA in which one (1) or more public charter schools or child care
agencies operate shall submit a comprehensive listing of all underutilized property or
vacant property to the department of education and the comptroller of the treasury. The

(3) A public charter school or child care agency may petition the comptroller of
the treasury for an audit of the list of all underutilized property or vacant property
submitted by the LEA in which the public charter school or child care agency are, or will
be, geographically located. The comptroller of the treasury is authorized to promulgate

(i) Purchase vacant property listed by the LEA under this section
at or below fair market value for educational purposes or for child care
use; or
(ii) Lease underutilized property or vacant property listed by the
LEA under this section at or below fair market value for educational
purposes or for child care use. A lease agreement executed between a
public charter school and an LEA or a child care agency and an LEA must
not reflect any outstanding bonded debt on the underutilized property or
vacant property, except as agreed upon to reflect any necessary costs
associated with the occupation or remodeling of the facility.
(B) For purposes of this subsection (c):
(i) "Fair market value for educational purposes" is determined by
taking the average of two (2) separate appraisals conducted by two (2)
independent, qualified appraisers, one (1) selected by the LEA and one
(1) selected by the public charter school; and
(ii) "Child care use" is determined by taking the average of two (2)
separate appraisals, one (1) selected by the LEA and one (1) selected by
the child care agency.
(5)
(A) Upon the execution of a lease agreement pursuant to this section, a
public charter school or child care agency has unrestricted use of the property.
The public charter school or child care agency shall provide for routine
maintenance and repair so that the leased property is maintained in as good of
order as when the lease was executed. The public charter school or child care
agency is responsible for paying all utilities used by the public charter school or

child care agency at the leased property. Extensive repairs to buildings or
facilities considered capital expenses are the responsibility of the LEA funding
body and not the public charter school or child care agency. If the public charter
school or child care agency makes extensive repairs to buildings or facilities
considered capital expenses, then the capital expenses must be credited against
the cost of the lease. Any fixtures, improvements, or tangible assets added to
leased property by the public charter school or child care agency pursuant to this
section must remain at the leased property upon the public charter school's or
child care agency's return of the leased property to the LEA.
(B) If the LEA decides to sell the school building that the public charter
school or child care agency is leasing, then the public charter school or child care
agency must be provided the right of first refusal to purchase the school building
at or below fair market value for educational purposes or for child care use, less
the value of all rental payments made to the LEA during the term of the lease.
(C) If, during the term of the lease, the public charter school or child care
agency closes or ceases using the building, then the building must be placed on
the LEA's vacant or underutilized property list pursuant to this subsection (c).
(6) If, after the purchase of vacant or underutilized property from an LEA
pursuant to this subsection (c), the public charter school or child care agency closes or
ceases using the property, then the LEA has the right of first refusal to purchase the
property from the public charter school or child care agency at or below fair market value
for educational purposes or for child care use. This subdivision (c)(6) does not require a
public charter school or child care agency to sell property owned by the public charter
school, the charter management organization, or the child care agency.
