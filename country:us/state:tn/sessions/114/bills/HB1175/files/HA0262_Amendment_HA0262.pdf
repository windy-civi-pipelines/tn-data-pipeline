(1) or more public charter schools" and by adding the language "or child care agency" after the
language "used by a public charter school".
SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 49, Chapter 2, Part 1, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:
(a) As used in this section:
(1) "Child care agency" means a child care agency as defined in ยง 71-3-

available to each child care agency operating in the LEA.

promulgate rules, in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act,
compiled in title 4, chapter 5, for the administration of this subsection (c).
(d)
(1) A child care agency that is operating in an LEA that does not have
one (1) or more public charter schools operating within the geographic
boundaries of the LEA has a right of first refusal to:
(A) Purchase vacant property listed by the LEA under this section
at or below fair market value for child care purposes; or
(B) Lease underutilized property or vacant property listed by the
LEA under this section at or below fair market value for child care
purposes. A lease agreement executed between a child care agency and
an LEA must not reflect any outstanding bonded debt on the underutilized
property or vacant property, except as agreed upon to reflect any
necessary costs associated with the occupation or remodeling of the
agency.
(2) If one (1) or more public charter schools operate in the LEA in which
a child care agency also operates, then a child care agency operating in the LEA
has a right of second refusal to purchase vacant property or lease underutilized
property or vacant property listed by the LEA in the same manner and to the
same extent as provided in subdivision (d)(1).
(3) For purposes of this subsection (d), fair market value for child care
purposes is determined by taking the average of two (2) separate appraisals
conducted by two (2) independent, qualified appraisers, one (1) selected by the
LEA and one (1) selected by the child care agency.
(e)
(1) Upon the execution of a lease agreement pursuant to this section, the
child care agency has unrestricted use of the property; provided, that the
- 2 - 005969

property must be used to provide child care services. The child care agency
shall provide for routine maintenance and repair so that the leased property is
maintained in as good of order as when the lease was executed. The child care
agency is responsible for paying all utilities used by the child care agency at the
leased property. Extensive repairs to buildings or facilities considered capital
expenses are the responsibility of the LEA funding body and not the child care
agency. If the owner or operator of the child care agency makes extensive
repairs to buildings or facilities considered capital expenses, then the capital
expenses must be credited against the cost of the lease. Any fixtures,
improvements, or tangible assets added to leased property by the child care
agency pursuant to this section must remain at the leased property upon the
child care agency's return of the leased property to the LEA.
(2) If the LEA decides to sell the school building that a child care agency
is leasing, then the child care agency must be provided the right of first refusal to
purchase the school building at or below fair market value for child care
purposes, as described in subdivision (d)(3), less the value of all rental payments
made to the LEA during the term of the lease.
(3) If, during the term of the lease, the child care agency closes or
ceases using the building, then the building must be placed on the LEA's vacant
or underutilized property list pursuant to this section.
(f) If, after the purchase of vacant or underutilized property from an LEA
pursuant to this section, the child care agency closes or ceases using the property, then
the LEA has the right of first refusal to purchase the property from the child care agency
at or below fair market value for child care purposes, as described in subdivision (d)(3).
This subsection (f) does not require a child care agency to sell any property other than
the property sold to the child care agency by the LEA pursuant to this section, if the LEA
elects to exercise its right of first refusal.

(g) The comptroller of the treasury may promulgate rules, in accordance with the
Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, for the
administration of this section.
(h) This section is not intended to frustrate an LEA's ability to plan for the use of
underutilized properties or vacant properties owned or operated by the LEA. In any LEA
in which a child care agency operates, the LEA shall submit each year its plans for the
use of underutilized or vacant properties owned or operated by the LEA in its annual
report to the department of human services and the comptroller of the treasury.
SECTION 3. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 71-3-501, is amended by adding the
following as a new subdivision:
( ) "Host school" means a public or private school that has a child care agency or
early learning program operating at the school, but that is not affiliated with the school;
SECTION 4. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 71-3-502(d)(3), is amended by
deleting the subdivision and substituting:
(3) If the department determines that any of the criteria in subdivision (d)(2) has
not been or cannot be met, then it may deny an application for a provisional license.
The department shall not deny a provisional license under this subdivision (d)(3) if:
(A) A host school's fire inspection is sufficient to meet the department's
requirements for a provisional license as described in subdivision (d)(2) for a
child care agency or early learning program operating at the host school for same
age children as in the host school; and
(B) The host school's facilities are sufficient to meet the department's
requirements as described in subdivision (d)(2) for a provisional license.
SECTION 5. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 71, Chapter 3, Part 5, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:
(a) As used in this section:
- 4 - 005969

(1) "Child care family home" means a family child care home that is
operated in an occupied residential dwelling; and
(2) "Local governing authority" means the governing body of the
municipality or county where a child care family home is located.
(b)
(1) Except as required by subdivision (b)(2), a local governing authority
shall treat a child care family home as residential property in the application of
local regulations, including:
(A) Zoning;
(B) Land use development; and
(C) Sanitation.
(2) A local governing authority shall apply the standards adopted by the
state fire marshal pursuant to ยง 68-120-101 to a child care family home for the
following:
(A) Fire and life safety standards; and
(B) Applicable building codes.
(c) For zoning purposes, "residential property use" includes single-family
residential zoning.
(d) For a child care family home, a local governing authority shall not impose:
(1) Stricter requirements than those established by the division of fire
prevention; or
(2) Any additional regulations that do not apply to other residential
properties.
(e) This section does not restrict a local governing authority from managing the
flow of traffic and parking adjacent to a child care family home.
