HOUSE BILL 218
By Behn
SENATE BILL 270
By Oliver
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4,
Chapter 51; Title 49 and Title 67, relative to the
"Universal Pre-K Funding Act."
WHEREAS, the Committee for Economic Development began issuing its "Child Care in
State Economies" report in 2015; and
WHEREAS, as detailed in these reports, the Committee for Economic Development has
found that access to affordable child care increases labor force participation and supports state
and local economic growth; and
WHEREAS, the Committee for Economic Development also determined that access to
affordable child care supports parents seeking additional education and training, which
contributes to higher earnings over an individual's lifetime; and
WHEREAS, according to the 2022 Brookings Institute's article "What Does the
Tennessee Pre-K Study Really Tell Us About Public Preschool Programs?", on average,
children who attended preschool enter kindergarten with stronger school readiness skills than if
they had stayed home; and
WHEREAS, the Brookings Institute also determined that benefits from preschool are
greater for children from families with low incomes, dual-language learners, and children of
color; and
WHEREAS, the Brookings Institute found that without public programs, both
economically marginalized and middle-class families often have trouble affording preschool and
are left with lower-quality options than they would like; and

WHEREAS, research shows that enrolling children in a full-day universal pre-
kindergarten program increases parents' work hours and raises their earnings by 21.7%, lasting
for at least six years; and
WHEREAS, pre-kindergarten programs in this State have been voluntary and dependent
on federal and other funding; and
WHEREAS, in order to establish a universal pre-kindergarten program throughout
Tennessee, it is necessary to develop a dedicated source of funding; and
WHEREAS, the taxation of digital advertising can provide a stable and dedicated source
of funds to support a universal pre-kindergarten program; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. This act is known and may be cited as the "Universal Pre-K Funding Act."
SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-6-103, is amended by deleting the
language "on a voluntary basis" in subsection (a); by deleting the language ", nor shall anything

program authorized by §§ 49-6-104 – 49-6-110" in subsection (b); and by deleting subsection
(c) and substituting instead the following:
(c) Each LEA shall provide a pre-kindergarten program that provides the number
of classrooms necessary to serve all eligible children, as defined in § 49-6-104.
SECTION 3. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-6-104, is amended by deleting the

the educational needs of the children enrolled in the program, including, but not limited
to, the child's cognitive, physical, social, and emotional needs.
(c) Each LEA shall establish an initial enrollment deadline for eligible children to
enroll in the pre-kindergarten program. If, in the application period for a school year, the
number of program applications received by the LEA exceeds the number of students
the LEA is able to serve, then the LEA shall select students for participation in the pre-
kindergarten program through an enrollment lottery process.
(d) A pre-kindergarten program established pursuant to this section must:
(1) Consist of a maximum class size of twenty (20) students;
(2) Have at least one (1) licensed teacher per classroom who is certified
in early childhood education;
(3) Have at least one (1) educational assistant per classroom who holds
a child development associate credential or associate degree in early childhood
education, or who is actively working toward acquiring such credentials;
provided, however, that if a person with such credentials is unavailable, then
educational assistants who hold a high school diploma and who have relevant
experience working with children in pre-kindergarten or other early childhood
programs may be employed to satisfy this requirement;
(4) Provide a minimum of five and one-half (5.5) hours of quality
instructional time per day;

geographical area served by the LEA, including, but not limited to, nonprofit and for-profit
child care providers and Head Start programs. An LEA shall not contract or collaborate
with a child care provider licensed by the department of human services, unless the
provider has attained the highest designation under the rated licensing system
administered by the department, pursuant to title 71, chapter 3, part 5.
(b) LEAs shall use the pre-k/kindergarten growth portfolio model approved by
the state board of education, or a comparable alternative measure of student growth
approved by the state board of education and adopted by the LEA, in the evaluation of
pre-kindergarten and kindergarten teachers pursuant to § 49-1-302.

education shall allocate to each LEA an amount sufficient for the LEA to serve all eligible
children, as defined in § 49-6-104, in the LEA's pre-kindergarten program.
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), if an LEA receives an allocation pursuant to
this section that is less than the allocation the LEA received for the prior school year,
then the local government may appropriate and allocate funds to the LEA to make up for
the state cuts without being subject to a continuation of funding effort requirement as to
those funds for any year during which the state reinstates the funding or restores the
previous cuts, and during any subsequent year should the state fail to restore the
funding cuts.

§ 67-4-1307, must be made available for appropriation and expenditure in accordance
with this section.
(d) An eligible child, as defined in § 49-6-104, is not required to pay tuition or

office of early learning's website to provide public access to the report.
SECTION 8. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 67, Chapter 4, is amended by adding
the following as a new part:
67-4-1301. Findings.
The general assembly finds and declares the following:
(1) The largest internet corporations use their monopolistic control of
essential online platforms to extract economic rents from their users in the form
of personal data. This personal data is highly valuable and acquired at a steep
discount, as demonstrated by the massive profit these corporations make selling
this information to digital advertisers. For the purposes of stability and equity in
the tax base, such economic rents are a favorable target for taxation;
(2) Tennessee sales and use tax statutes provide that specified digital
products are taxed at the state rate of seven percent (7%) and a standard local
tax rate of two and one-half percent (2.5%), instead of the local tax rate in effect
in a county or municipality. However, many digital transactions are hard to bring
into the digital sales tax base because instead of paying a monetary fee,
customers sometimes barter their personal information for access to digital
platforms. This personal information is in turn sold for use in targeted
advertisements on digital platforms. To tax this consumption, leading tax
economists have suggested using the receipts earned from digital data
transactions as a proxy for the value of the barter;
- 6 - 000864

(3) As has been noted by many, including the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), the value of the consumption provided
by digital platforms is typically greater as the size of its network is greater. As
such, the general assembly finds that the consumption value provided by
networks of a small size is negligible, especially when compared to the
compliance burden that would be imposed on smaller digital platforms; and
(4) Digital advertising is not substantially similar to traditional print or
broadcast advertising, as traditional advertising neither relies on the extraction of
valuable personal information from users, nor does it serve as a proxy for
currently untaxed consumption.
67-4-1302. Part definitions.
As used in this part, unless the context otherwise requires:
(1) "Annual gross revenues" means income or revenue from all sources,
