agency of this state, or of a county or municipal government, approves a grant of funds
for, or issues a license to, a person or institution for which a certificate of need was
required but was not granted, then the license is void, and the person or institution shall
refund the funds to the state within ninety (90) days. The health facilities commission

jurisdiction to enjoin a person who is in violation of this part.
(c)
(1) For each application, a letter of intent must be filed between the first
day of the month and the fifteenth day of the month prior to the application's
submission. At the time of filing, the applicant shall cause the letter of intent to
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed service area
of the project. The published letter of intent must contain a statement that any:
- 3 - 001424

(A) Healthcare institution wishing to oppose the application must
file written notice with the commission no later than fifteen (15) days
before the commission meeting at which the application is originally
scheduled; and
(B) Other person wishing to oppose the application may file a
written objection with the commission at or prior to the consideration of
the application by the commission, or may appear in person to express
opposition.
(2) Persons desiring to file a certificate of need application seeking a
simultaneous review regarding a similar project for which a letter of intent has
been filed shall file with the commission a letter of intent between the sixteenth
day of the month and the last day of the month of publication of the first filed
letter of intent. A copy of a letter of intent filed after the first letter of intent must
be mailed or delivered to the first filed applicant and must be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the proposed service area of the first filed
applicant. The health facilities commission shall consider and decide the
applications simultaneously. However, the commission may refuse to consider
the applications simultaneously if it finds that the applications do not meet the
requirements of "simultaneous review" under the rules of the commission.
(3) Applications for a certificate of need, including simultaneous review
applications, must be filed by the first business day of the month following the
date of publication of the letter of intent.
(4) If there are two (2) or more applications to be reviewed
simultaneously in accordance with this part and the rules of the commission, and

are deemed complete by the deadline must be considered at the next

considered at the next commission meeting.
(5) Review cycles begin on the fifteenth day of each month. Review
cycles are thirty (30) days. The first meeting at which an application can be
considered by the commission is the meeting following the application's review
cycle. If an application is not deemed complete within sixty (60) days after initial
written notification is given to the applicant by commission staff that the
application is deemed incomplete, then the application is void. If the applicant
decides to resubmit the application, then the applicant shall comply with all
procedures as set out by this part and pay a new filing fee when submitting the
application. Prior to deeming an application complete, the executive director
shall ensure independent review and verification of information submitted to the
commission in applications, presentations, or otherwise. The purpose of the
independent review and verification is to ensure that the information is accurate,
complete, comprehensive, timely, and relevant to the decision to be made by the
commission. The independent review and verification must be applied, but not
necessarily be limited, to applicant-provided information as to the number of
available beds within a region, occupancy rates, the number of individuals on
waiting lists, the demographics of a region, the number of procedures, and other
critical information submitted or requested concerning an application, and staff

examinations of data sources, data input, data processing, and data output, and
verification of critical information.
(6) An application filed with the commission must be accompanied by a
nonrefundable examination fee fixed by the rules of the commission. The
examination fee may be applied to a second application for the same project if
the letter of intent for the first application is voided for non-compliance with law or
rule by the executive director, the commission, or a court. The second
application must be filed with the commission within ninety (90) days of the
voiding of the first letter of intent for the examination fee to be applied.
(7) Information provided in the application or information submitted to the
commission in support of an application must be true and correct. Substantive
amendments to the application, as defined by rule of the commission, are not
allowed.

for the applicant and shall notify the commission, in writing, of the contact
person's name, address, and telephone number. The applicant shall immediately
notify the commission in writing of a change in the identity or contact information
of the contact person. In addition to other methods of service permitted by law,
the commission may serve by registered or certified mail a notice or other legal
document upon the contact person at the person's last address of record in the
files of the commission. Notwithstanding a law to the contrary, service in the
manner specified in this subdivision (c)(8) constitutes actual service upon the
applicant.
(9)
- 6 - 001424

(A) If an application involves a healthcare facility in which a
county or municipality is the lessor of the facility or real property on which
it sits, then, within ten (10) days of filing the application, the applicant
shall notify the chief executive officer of the county or municipality of the
filing, by certified mail, return receipt requested.
(B) An application subject to the notification requirements of this
subdivision (c)(9) is not complete if the applicant has not provided proof of
compliance with this subdivision (c)(9) to the commission.
(d) Communications with the members of the commission are not permitted
once the letter of intent initiating the application process is filed with the commission.

to a healthcare institution due to a change in the number of licensed beds,
redistribution of beds, or relocation of beds pursuant to this section.
(g) After a person holding a certificate of need has completed the actions for
which the certificate of need was granted, the time to complete activities authorized by
the certificate of need expires.

increase its total number of licensed beds by the lesser of ten (10) beds or ten
percent (10%) of its licensed capacity no more frequently than one (1) time every
three (3) years without obtaining a certificate of need. The nursing home shall
provide written notice of the increase in beds to the commission on forms
provided by the commission prior to the request for licensing by the board for
licensing healthcare facilities.

be requested until one (1) year after the date all of the new beds were initially
licensed.

beds, plus the number of beds from approved certificates of need, but yet
unlicensed.
