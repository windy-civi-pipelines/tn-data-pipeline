twenty-three (23) years of age and who is the dependent child of a law
enforcement officer or firefighter who was killed, or who died as a direct result of
injuries received, while performing their official duties as a law enforcement
officer or firefighter, is entitled to a waiver of tuition, maintenance fees, student
activity fees, and any required registration or matriculation fees at the public
institution of higher education at which the dependent child is enrolled.
(2) The tuition and fee waiver established in subdivision (b)(1) is only
available in an academic year for which the general assembly has appropriated

dependent child must present to the public institution of higher education at which the
dependent child is enrolled official certification from the state, local government, agency,
or department that employed the law enforcement officer or firefighter verifying that the
law enforcement officer or firefighter was killed, or died as a direct result of injuries
received, while performing their official duties as a law enforcement officer or firefighter.
(d) A dependent child who qualifies for a waiver of tuition and fees pursuant to
this section after the dependent child has paid all tuition and fees assessed for the term
by the public institution of higher education at which the dependent child is enrolled, is
not entitled to any refund or credit in the amount of the previously paid tuition and fees.

strictly applied. To be eligible for a waiver of tuition and fees pursuant to this section, the
dependent child must be matriculated as a full-time student at a public institution of
higher education before attaining twenty-three (23) years of age. Once declared eligible,
