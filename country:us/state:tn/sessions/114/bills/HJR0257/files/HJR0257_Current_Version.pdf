HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 257
By Powers
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Farmers Helping
Farmers initiative and its leader, Dan Pearman,
for their remarkable efforts in assisting fellow
farmers in East Tennessee.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should specially
recognize those estimable citizens and initiatives that have contributed significantly to the
betterment of their communities; and
WHEREAS, one such initiative is the Farmers Helping Farmers relief effort, which began
with a heartfelt post from Dan Pearman, who wanted farmers in Cocke and Greene counties to
know they were not alone in the aftermath of the terrible devastation brought by Hurricane
Helene in September 2024; and
WHEREAS, Dan Pearman, along with farmers in Claiborne County, organized efforts to
gather hay and supplies for farmers in Greene and Cocke counties, lining up approximately 500
rolls of hay and a significant amount of feed and other essentials; and
WHEREAS, some fifteen trucks loaded with supplies soon pulled out from Mays'
Loadout Barn on Highway 63 bound for Cocke County, with the commitment that this would not
be the last convoy, and that future efforts would focus on Greene County as well; and
WHEREAS, Dan Pearman's leadership and the spirit of "farmers helping farmers" have
inspired countless individuals to come together, providing hope and support to those affected by
adverse conditions; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Pearman was recently recognized at the Tennessee Cattlemen's
Association convention in Murfreesboro, receiving the John Bartee Distinguished Service Award
for his leadership in organizing multiple hay convoys to Cocke, Greene, and Unicoi counties to
assist livestock producers with feeding their animals in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene; and

WHEREAS, in total, over 130 loads of donated hay, feed, and other supplies were
provided to the affected farmers, demonstrating the power of community and collective effort;
and
WHEREAS, having recently experienced a couple of life-threatening medical conditions,
Dan Pearman felt a divine calling to help, and his efforts, along with the generous contributions
of many others, resulted in substantial relief for those in need; and
WHEREAS, the Farmers Helping Farmers initiative to assist recovery efforts in East
Tennessee after Hurricane Helene involved some 125 people in Cocke County, 190 people in
Greene County, and 140 people in Unicoi County, who collectively donated hay, time, and other
resources; and
WHEREAS, the actions of Dan Pearman and the Farmers Helping Farmers initiative
stand as a testament to the power of dedication, compassion, and leadership, and they are
wholly deserving of the respect and admiration of this General Assembly; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend the Farmers Helping Farmers initiative and Dan
Pearman for their outstanding efforts in assisting fellow farmers in East Tennessee and extend
