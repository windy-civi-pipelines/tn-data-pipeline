SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 50-6-201, is amended by deleting the
section and substituting:
(a) An injured employee or the injured employee's representative shall,
immediately upon the occurrence of an injury, or as soon thereafter as is reasonable and
practicable, give or cause to be given to the employer who has no actual notice, written
notice of the injury, and the employee is not entitled to physician's fees or to any
compensation that may have accrued under this chapter, from the date of the accident to
the giving of notice, unless it can be shown that the employer had actual knowledge of
the accident. Compensation is not payable under this chapter unless the written notice
is given to the employer within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of the accident,
unless reasonable excuse for failure to give the notice is made to the satisfaction of the
tribunal to which the claim for compensation may be presented.
(b) In those cases where the injuries occur as the result of gradual or cumulative
events or trauma, the injured employee or the injured employee's representative shall
provide notice of the injury to the employer within fifteen (15) days from the date the
employee:
(1) Knows or reasonably should know that the employee has suffered a
work-related injury that has resulted in permanent physical impairment; or

the employer by the employee or the employee's representative must state in

place, nature, and cause of the accident resulting in injury or death. The notice
must be signed by the claimant or by a person authorized to sign on the
claimant's behalf, or by one (1) or more of the claimant's dependents if the
accident resulted in death to the employee.
(2) A defect or inaccuracy in the written notice is not a bar to
compensation, unless the employer can show, to the satisfaction of the workers'
compensation judge before which the matter is pending, that the employer was
prejudiced by the failure to give the proper written notice, and then only to the
extent of the prejudice.
(3) The notice must be given to the employer or to the employer's agent
