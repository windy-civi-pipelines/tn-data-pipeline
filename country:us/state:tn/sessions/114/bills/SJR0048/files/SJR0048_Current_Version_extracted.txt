Communications Board.
WHEREAS, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 7-86-102(b)(1), the
General Assembly finds that the establishment of a uniform emergency number to shorten the
time required for a citizen to request and receive emergency aid is a matter of public interest
and concern. The General Assembly finds also that the continued viability of the lifesaving 911
emergency communications service is of the highest priority for the health and safety of the
citizens of Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, pursuant to Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 7-86-128(a)(2), any
change in the 911 surcharge amount set by law is required to be set at a level that is sufficient
to fully fund the mandatory disbursements to emergency communications districts, the
operational expenses of the State Emergency Communications Board, and the Tennessee
Relay Services/Telecommunications Devices Access Program (TRS/TDAP) as provided in
Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 65-21-115. In the event of any revenue shortfall,
mandatory disbursements to the emergency communications districts and the TRS/TDAP are
required to be given priority. Revenues from the surcharge are required to be used to support
the long-term solvency and operations of emergency communications districts, as well as
reasonable and necessary administrative and operational expenses of the board and the 911
Emergency Communications Fund; and
WHEREAS, in Tennessee, the current statewide 911 surcharge rate of $1.50 has been
in effect since January 1, 2021; and
