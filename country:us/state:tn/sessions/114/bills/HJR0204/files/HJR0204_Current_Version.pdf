HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 204
By Keisling
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend 2024 Marble King, Myles
Lacy, on his victory at the National Marbles
Tournament.
WHEREAS, from time to time, the members of this General Assembly pause in their
deliberations to recognize those intrepid game players who have developed their skills to a
sublime level and have found success at the highest echelons of their game; and
WHEREAS, Myles Lacy of Celina is one such individual, who captured first place in the
boys' championship of the National Marbles Tournament, held in Wildwood, New Jersey; and
WHEREAS, the youngest boy to ever win the title, Myles dominated the final fifteen-
game series with an 8-3 landslide that unquestionably cemented his place in the annals of
national marble history, earned him the venerable title of "Marble King," and made him the
fourth Clay County and seventh Tennessee-Kentucky region winner since the competition's
inception in 1922; and
WHEREAS, Myles accomplished this estimable feat on his third attempt and improved at
each of his showings, demonstrating the dedication and resilience common to successful
competitors in all sports; and
WHEREAS, he has enjoyed such varied spoils as being recognized during the Old
Dominion concert at the Barefoot Country Music Fest and on social media by Nashville
television personality Nick Beres; being interviewed by Philip Gibbons of 94.7 The Giant; being
triumphantly escorted into town on his return journey by the police; and being awarded a $2,000
scholarship, a sizable trophy, and a crown appropriate to his title; and

WHEREAS, Myles hails from a renowned marble legacy; his late grandfather William
"Shorty" Denton won the 1990 National Rolley Championship with Gary Plumlee and is still
reckoned as one of the greatest players to ever circle the ring; and
WHEREAS, his plunking was outstanding, his bombsies were accurate, and he earned
the respect of his opponents when he knuckled down with his shooters; and
WHEREAS, Myles's hard work and spectacular game play reflect his hard work,
unwavering dedication, and innate ability while also serving as testimony to the guidance and
leadership of his coach, Brian Cherry, who has successfully coached two other members of
marble royalty; and
WHEREAS, Myles Lacy has, through his success amongst the nation's finest players,
brought honor to the State of Tennessee, and it is wholly fitting that he be formally recognized
for his tremendous accomplishment; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we commend and congratulate Myles Lacy on his capture of first place at
the boys' championship of the National Marbles Tournament, extending our best wishes for his
every future success.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
