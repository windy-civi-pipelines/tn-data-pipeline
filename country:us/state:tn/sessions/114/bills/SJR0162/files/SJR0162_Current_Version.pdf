SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 162
By Oliver
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the memory of Dr.
Charles Edward Dudley, Sr., for his outstanding
spiritual leadership in the Seventh-day Adventist
Church.
WHEREAS, it is the pleasure of the members of this General Assembly to acknowledge
the memory of those venerable men and women who were willing to dedicate their lives to
ensure the individual and collective freedom of oppressed groups across the nation; and
WHEREAS, one such distinguished individual is Dr. Charles Edward Dudley, Sr., a civil
rights activist, Seventh-day Adventist conference leader, and minister; and
WHEREAS, born on February 1, 1927, in South Bend, Indiana, Dr. Dudley was the
grandson of some of the formerly enslaved founders of the Thomas Chapel Methodist Episcopal
Church in Hickman, Kentucky, an inspiring mantle that Dr. Dudley would gracefully carry on in
his ministerial endeavors and pursuit of racial justice; and
WHEREAS, the youngest of Joseph and Julia Dudley's seven children, Dr. Dudley spent
his childhood in South Bend before transferring to complete high school at Oakwood Academy
in Huntsville, Alabama, and he followed the Oakwood track to Oakwood College, where he
graduated with a Bachelor of Ministry and met his wife, Etta Mae Maycock; and
WHEREAS, his first nineteen years of service in the Seventh-day Adventist Church
concentrated on ministry in numerous states throughout the South, pastoring communities
wherever he was called, and in 1962, he became the president of the South Central
Conference, which oversees the missional needs of African-American communities in Alabama,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, the northeast sections of Arkansas, and the
panhandle of Florida; and

WHEREAS, Dr. Dudley's time as president, which spanned an unprecedented thirty-one
years, saw striking growth in membership, from 4,300 to 23,000 members; the construction of
approximately 100 new church and school structures; and the acquisition of government support
through the Housing and Urban Development Act for seven federally subsidized housing
complexes for the underprivileged and elderly, including in Nashville and Clarksville; and
WHEREAS, he deftly balanced his righteous indignation at the evil of racial inequality
with his diplomatic skill and tact to achieve institutional progress for his flock amid the
tumultuous times of the Civil Rights movement in the South; and
WHEREAS, cognizant of the unique challenges facing the Black Adventist community,
Dr. Dudley was indispensable to the creation of unions between other Black conferences in the
North American Division of the Seventh-day Adventist Church; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Dudley was convinced of the greater efficacy of local bodies in
producing real change, and he refused consideration for higher offices in order to continue his
work at the regional level; and
WHEREAS, a man of myriad talents, Dr. Dudley was a gifted vocalist and journalist, and
he utilized the latter skill to write several studies in his retirement; and
WHEREAS, he maintained a great love and support for education, and he rendered
extended service as vice chairman of the Oakwood College Board of Trustees, a tenure that
saw the school's enrollment more than triple, growing from approximately 400 to over 1,400
students; and
WHEREAS, apart from his work in ministry and leadership, Dr. Dudley was also deeply
devoted to his family, especially his three children, Bonita, Charles II, and Albert; despite his
many and great responsibilities, he always endeavored to remain true to family values of the
highest order; and
