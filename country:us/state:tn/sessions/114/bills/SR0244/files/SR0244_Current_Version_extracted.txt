Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 244
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Kameron Whalum of
Memphis.
WHEREAS, Kameron Whalum is a multifaceted musician whose warm trombone tone,
soulful voice, and stage charisma have earned him a permanent place in pop culture's top
echelon; and
WHEREAS, best known for his long-running role with Grammy-winning superstar Bruno
Mars—and more recently as a founding member of Silk Sonic—Kameron embodies the sound
and soul of contemporary R&B with roots that reach deep into the cultural bedrock of Memphis;
and
WHEREAS, raised in a family that breathes music, Kameron is the youngest of three
brothers (Kenneth and Kortland) and part of a musical dynasty that includes the iconic Kirk
Whalum; music was never just a hobby—it was the fabric of daily life; and
WHEREAS, surrounded by singers, instrumentalists, and pastors, Kameron's love for
music grew naturally, nurtured by Sunday services, school bands, and summer sessions at the
Stax Music Academy; and
WHEREAS, a proud alumnus of Morehouse College, Kameron immersed himself in jazz
band, marching band, and glee club before continuing his studies at the University of Memphis
and eventually The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in New York City, New York;
and
WHEREAS, it was in New York that his big break emerged—his brother Kenneth was
asked to assemble a horn section for a Bruno Mars performance, and Kameron got the call;

what was supposed to be a one-night gig became a permanent role on world tours, award
shows, and international stages; and
WHEREAS, from playing sold-out stadiums to collaborating in the studio on hits like
"Leave the Door Open" with Silk Sonic, Kameron's musicianship is defined by soul, subtlety,
and spiritual grounding; he brings not just technique, but heart, to every performance—always
connecting to something deeper than the note itself; and
WHEREAS, Kameron is also deeply committed to mentorship and legacy-building. As
an ambassador for Berklee's City Music program, he empowers young musicians to pursue their
dreams, emphasizing self-belief, purpose, and cultural pride. "I want to show students that it's
not a pipe dream," he says. "It's right there. If you believe, you've got to believe all the way";
and
WHEREAS, his reflections on Black history and Memphis music speak to his profound
understanding of lineage and responsibility. Kameron honors those who paved the way—from
his ancestors to his uncles—while carrying the torch forward with authenticity and gratitude.
"We come from kings and queens," he says. "Now it's our turn";
WHEREAS, still evolving, Kameron continues to tour, record, and uplift the next
generation—forever grounded in the Memphis soul that made him; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor Kameron Whalum,
reflecting on his contributions to music and his enduring legacy of excellence and creativity.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.
