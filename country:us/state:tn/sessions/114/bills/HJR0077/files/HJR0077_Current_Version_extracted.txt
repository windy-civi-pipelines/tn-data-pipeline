Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 77
By Butler
A RESOLUTION to commend ongoing efforts to facilitate
additional power generation capacity by TVA-
affiliated distributors.
WHEREAS, created in 1933 by the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, the Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA), a corporate agency of the United States, is the wholesale power
provider for 154 local power companies that distribute electricity to homes, businesses, and
industry across seven states, including the State of Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, TVA is the wholesale power provider for virtually all of Tennessee's ninety-
five counties; in the State of Tennessee, TVA power is delivered by twenty-two electric
membership cooperatives and sixty municipal power companies that provide power to 2.9
million households and 487,000 commercial and industrial customers; and
WHEREAS, in an unprecedented event on December 23-24, 2022, during Winter Storm
Elliott, many Tennessee residents, businesses, and industries experienced power interruptions
conducted by local power providers, as required by TVA to support electrical grid stability; and
WHEREAS, extreme widespread cold weather resulted in record-high power demands;
power interruptions were necessary to preserve electrical grid stability due to lower than
expected TVA generation production, higher than expected need for electricity, and decreased
availability of power market purchases; and
WHEREAS, distributors that purchase their power requirements from TVA may deploy
their own energy resources to produce their own power in total capacity amount not to exceed
ten percent of the distributor's energy demand; and

WHEREAS, empowering distributors to provide additional generation capacity will
stimulate the local economy through jobs while strengthening the ability to continue providing
dependable, reliable, and economically feasible electric service to the State's vibrant and
growing economy, supporting Tennessee's residents; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that this General Assembly commends ongoing efforts to facilitate additional
power generation capacity by TVA-affiliated distributors.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this resolution be transmitted to
the TVA Board of Directors.
