SENATE BILL 1044
By Bowling
HOUSE BILL 746
By Fritts
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 49,
relative to public schools.
WHEREAS, one of the duties of the General Assembly is to protect the citizen and
public funding base from costs that should not be borne by public funding; and
WHEREAS, Article XI, Section 12 of the Constitution of Tennessee clearly assigns
authority to the General Assembly to provide for the maintenance, support, and eligibility
standards for a system of free public schools; and
WHEREAS, the provisions of the constitution guaranteeing equal protection of the law to
all citizens require that the educational opportunities provided by the system of free public
schools be substantially equal; and
WHEREAS, the ability to maintain a system of free public schools is jeopardized if the
eligibility standards are interpreted to include all citizens of the world who are not Tennessee
citizens; and
WHEREAS, it is common to require information regarding Tennessee students as they
enroll to participate in free public schools and while children may attend public schools outside
their district, determining the residence of the child is important for numerous reasons; and
WHEREAS, it is a reasonable and fiscally responsible approach to require an investment
in the education costs for foreign children who are utilizing our system of free public schools;
and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds that this reasonable and fiscally responsible
approach provides all children an opportunity to attend schools receiving public funds in

the cost; now, therefore,
