WHEREAS, the members of the East Nashville High School girls' track and field team
distinguished themselves by winning the state championship with the fewest participating
athletes in history (seven); and

finishing the meet with 78 points; and

college scholarships, thirty-two of which are academic scholarships, in the past eighteen years;
and

of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, their perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent not only made
possible a championship season but also surely bode well for each athlete's future success; and
WHEREAS, we find it appropriate to acknowledge and applaud the East Nashville High
School girls' track and field team, not only for winning the state title but also for the athletes'
superior sportsmanship and the joy they brought to their fellow students and fans; now,
