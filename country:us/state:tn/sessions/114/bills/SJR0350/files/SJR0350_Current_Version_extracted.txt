Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 350
By Jackson
A RESOLUTION to commemorate the month of May 2025 as
Tennessee Shelter Animal Awareness Month.
WHEREAS, No-Kill is a community philosophy and commitment to saving every healthy
or treatable dog and cat in a shelter that can be saved, with at least ninety percent of the
companion animals that enter facilities leaving alive (Nokillfacts.com); and
WHEREAS, Tennessee's animal shelters will achieve a ninety percent save rate if six
percent or more Tennesseans seeking a pet choose to adopt from a shelter rather than
purchase; and
WHEREAS, many loving and healthy animals are waiting for homes in shelters and
rescues throughout Tennessee, and many Tennessee shelters implement proven programs and
policies to provide alternatives to the unnecessary killing of dogs and cats; and
WHEREAS, adoption provides dogs and cats a second chance at life and helps reduce
the strain on overcrowded shelters, and promoting pet adoption supports animal welfare and
encourages responsible pet ownership within the community; and
WHEREAS, Tennesseans should work together to achieve No-Kill in Tennessee in
2025, and animal shelters can do this by employing lifesaving programs such as foster care
networks; adoption programs; medical and behavioral programs; public education and
awareness programs; community cat trap, neuter, vaccinate, and return programs; and animal
socialization programs to prioritize lifesaving; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we join with the animal lovers of Tennessee as they
commemorate May 2025 as Tennessee Shelter Animal Awareness Month.
