deserving of the highest regard, the Eagleville High School Eagles baseball team captured the

2024 championship completes the three-peat, a rare accomplishment; and

seed in regional competition, Eagleville easily defeated Cornersville 9-3 and Richland 13-3 to
advance to the sectional round, in which the Eagles bested Collinwood 2-0 to secure a berth in
the state tournament; and
WHEREAS, arriving in Murfreesboro with an excellent 30-5 overall record, the Eagles
truly hit their stride, winning four consecutive games to be crowned state champions; and
WHEREAS, Eagleville walloped Union City 16-1, blasted Oakdale 17-2, and crushed
South Pittsburg 11-1 to reach the championship game of the state tourney unbeaten; and
