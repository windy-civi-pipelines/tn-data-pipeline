and other federal laws;

be contiguous by land to the county of which they are a part;
(c) Districts must reflect consideration of county and municipal boundaries;
(d) Districts must be reasonably compact;
(e) Districts must reflect the state's diverse population and communities of
interest. Communities of interest may include, but are not limited to, populations that
share cultural or historical characteristics or economic interests. Communities of interest
do not include relationships with political parties, incumbents, or political candidates;

which is to be determined using accepted measures of partisan fairness; and
(g) Districts shall not favor or disfavor an incumbent elected official or a
candidate.
Sec. 6h. Independent redistricting commission – Plan adoption procedure.

II, Section 6g;
- 9 - 000035

(b) Before voting to adopt a plan, the commission shall provide public notice of
each plan that will be voted on and provide at least forty-five days for public comment on
the proposed plan or plans. Each plan that will be voted on shall include such census
data as is necessary to accurately describe the plan and verify the population of each
district, and shall include the map and legal description required in Article II, Section 6i;
and
(c) A final decision of the commission to adopt a redistricting plan requires a
majority vote of the commission, including at least two commissioners who affiliate with
each major party, and at least two commissioners who do not affiliate with either major
party. If no plan satisfies this requirement for a type of district, then the commission
shall use the following procedure to adopt a plan for that type of district:
(1) Each commissioner may submit one proposed plan for each type of
district to the full commission for consideration;
(2) Each commissioner shall rank the plans submitted according to
preference. Each plan shall be assigned a point value inverse to its ranking
among the number of choices, giving the lowest ranked plan one point and the
highest ranked plan a point value equal to the number of plans submitted; and
(3) The commission shall adopt the plan receiving the highest total
points, that is also ranked among the top half of plans by at least two
commissioners not affiliated with the party of the commissioner submitting the
plan, or in the case of a plan submitted by non-affiliated commissioners, is
ranked among the top half of plans by at least two commissioners affiliated with a
major party. If plans are tied for the highest point total, then the secretary of
state shall randomly select the final plan from those plans. If no plan meets the
requirements of this subdivision (c)(3), then the secretary of state shall randomly
- 10 - 000035

select the final plan from among all submitted plans pursuant to subdivision
(c)(1).
Sec. 6i. Independent redistricting commission – Plan publication, reporting, and
effective date.
Within thirty days after adopting a plan, the commission shall publish the plan and the
material reports, reference materials, and data used in drawing it, including any programming
information used to produce and test the plan. The materials must be published in such a
manner that an independent person is able to replicate the conclusion without any modification
of any of the published materials.
For each adopted plan, the commission shall issue a report that explains the basis on
which the commission made its decisions in achieving compliance with plan requirements and
shall include the map and legal description required in Article II, Section 6e. A commissioner
who votes against a redistricting plan may submit a dissenting report to be issued with the
commission's report.
An adopted redistricting plan becomes law sixty days after its publication. The secretary
of state shall keep a public record of all proceedings of the commission and shall publish and
distribute each plan and required documentation.
Sec. 6j. Independent redistricting commission – Judicial review and severability.
The supreme court, in the exercise of original jurisdiction, shall direct the secretary of
state or the commission to perform their respective duties, may review a challenge to any plan
adopted by the commission, and shall remand a plan to the commission for further action if the
plan fails to comply with the requirements of this constitution, the constitution of the United
States, or superseding federal law. In no event shall any body, except the independent
redistricting commission acting pursuant to Article II, Sections 6a-6l, promulgate and adopt a
redistricting plan or plans for this state.
- 11 - 000035

Article II, Sections 6a-6l are self-executing. If a final court decision holds any part or
parts of these sections to be in conflict with the United States constitution or federal law, then
these sections shall be implemented to the maximum extent that the United States constitution
and federal law permit. Any provision held invalid is severable from the remaining portions of
these sections.
Sec. 6k. Independent redistricting commission – Constitutional interpretation and
protection of commission functions.
Notwithstanding this constitution, or any prior judicial decision, as of the effective date of
the constitutional amendment adding Article II, Sections 6a-6l, for purposes of interpreting this
constitutional amendment the people declare that the powers granted to the commission are
legislative functions not subject to the control or approval of the legislature, and are exclusively
reserved to the commission. The commission, and all of its responsibilities, operations,
functions, contractors, consultants, and employees are not subject to change, transfer,
reorganization, or reassignment, and shall not be altered or abrogated in any manner
whatsoever, by the legislature. No other body shall be established by law to perform functions
that are the same or similar to those granted to the commission in this section.
Sec. 6l. Independent redistricting commission – Anti-retaliation protections.
Notwithstanding any other law, an employer shall not discharge, threaten to discharge,
intimidate, coerce, or retaliate against any employee because of the employee's membership on
the commission or attendance or scheduled attendance at any meeting of the commission.
