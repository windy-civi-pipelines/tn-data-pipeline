WHEREAS, Ms. Whicker first found her niche in public speaking through her
participation in FFA, and she was the state winner for the FFA Prepared Public Speaking

represent Tennessee in this event at the FFA National Convention this past October, where she
was honored to be among the top eight in the nation who were named as Gold Emblem finalists;

hopes to raise a family and perhaps have a farm someday; and
