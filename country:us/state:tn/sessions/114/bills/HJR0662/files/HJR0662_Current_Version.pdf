those outstanding individuals who serve as advocates for the greater good, thereby contributing

the Giles County Rehab Unit, which she established in January 2024 to support local first
responders during extended emergency situations and trainings; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Ayres recognized the need for an area for first responders and
emergency personnel to rest and recover in order to continue performing their duties in times of
crisis; and
WHEREAS, Heather Ayres's unique perspective for her idea originated from witnessing
her husband and her son respond to emergency calls at all hours, specifically after her husband
answered a house fire call on a brutally cold winter day; and
WHEREAS, information regarding the Giles County Rehab Unit was shared across
social media platforms, and since then, it has grown from just a few cases of water to a trailer
with a staging area for nonperishable foods, pallets of water, hydrating drinks, and other
donations; and
