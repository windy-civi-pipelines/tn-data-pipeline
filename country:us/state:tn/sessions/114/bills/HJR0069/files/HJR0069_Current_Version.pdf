HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 69
By Martin B
A RESOLUTION relative to a plan to make Tennessee healthy.
WHEREAS, chronic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, account
for over 70 percent of healthcare costs and are the leading cause of death and disability in the
United States, impacting millions of families and straining public resources; and
WHEREAS, the chronic disease epidemic especially harms our young people, with 50
percent of young adults being obese, 77 percent of young adults being ineligible for military
service, and 40 percent of high school students having a mental health disorder; and
WHEREAS, 60 percent of Americans have a chronic disease; and
WHEREAS, 90 percent of deaths are tied to preventable chronic diseases; and
WHEREAS, 90 percent of chronic diseases are reversible; and
WHEREAS, the root causes of chronic disease are linked to preventable factors such as
poor nutrition, sedentary lifestyles, and lack of access to health education; and
WHEREAS, public policies that incentivize better health provide meaningful results that
empower people and communities; and
WHEREAS, the State of Tennessee and the United States require a paradigm shift in
healthcare policy that emphasizes the role of nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle medicine in
preventing and reversing chronic disease; and
WHEREAS, the State of Tennessee has a responsibility to its citizens to ensure
government policy serves to improve public health outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and
provide citizens the tools and resources to lead healthy, productive lives; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
HJR0069

CONCURRING, that the State support and adopt the following principles and priorities for a
healthier citizenry:
1. Reform the Food Economy.
a. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) should exclude ultra-
processed, high-sugar, and high-fat junk foods while incentivizing fresh, nutrient-dense
options.
b. State partnerships with local farmers, grocers, and schools should seek to
increase access to healthy, affordable food in underserved areas.
c. Crop subsidies should incentivize healthy, whole foods instead of ultra-
processed foods.
2. Support Lifestyle Medicine and Education.
a. Integration of health and wellness curricula into K-12 schools, focusing on
nutrition, exercise, and the long-term benefits of healthy living, would make our children
healthier.
b. Greater public access to lifestyle medicine practitioners through state
healthcare programs and partnerships with medical schools would improve health
outcomes.
c. Utilization of health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts to cover
more holistic and preventative care, such as exercise costs and nutritional supplements,
would create opportunities for better health.
3. Encourage Good Governance.
a. Conflicts of interest in the FDA, USDA, and other regulatory agencies lead to
flawed nutrition standards and must be eliminated.
b. Toxins banned in other developed countries are poisoning our food, water,
and consumer goods and should be banned here as well.

c. The FDA's slow and costly approval process stifles healthcare innovation.
4. Lead by Example in State Institutions.
a. Food served in state facilities, including schools and government offices,
should meet high nutritional standards.
b. Wellness programs and resources for state employees reduce healthcare
costs and improve productivity.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this resolution be transmitted to
the Governor of Tennessee, the Commissioner of Health, and the members of Tennessee's
congressional delegation, urging their active support and advocacies for policies that align with
these principles and requesting their participation in an annual "Make Tennessee Healthy"
summit to advance these goals for the health of all Tennesseans.
