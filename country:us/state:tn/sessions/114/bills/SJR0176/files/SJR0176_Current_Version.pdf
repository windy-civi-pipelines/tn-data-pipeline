SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 176
By Southerland
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Deputy Chief Sam
Hinson of the Sevierville Police Department on
his thirty years of service.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal concerns to ensure the public's safety and welfare, and the Volunteer State is
especially proud to be the home of so many valiant men and women who have performed
above and beyond the call of duty in service of public safety; and
WHEREAS, thousands of Tennesseans have continued the time-honored tradition of
service in law enforcement, dedicating their time and efforts to aiding those in emergency
situations and apprehending those who have broken the law; and
WHEREAS, Deputy Chief Sam Hinson of the Sevierville Police Department is one such
courageous law enforcement professional, who has epitomized the highest ideals of public
service and contributed greatly to the safety of the citizens of Sevierville and Sevier County; and
WHEREAS, an officer with the Sevierville Police Department since 1995, Deputy Chief
Hinson has displayed the spirit and commitment to family and community that are characteristic
of a true Tennessean; and
WHEREAS, first working as a patrolman, Deputy Chief Hinson began policing in
Sevierville when only four people were on patrol at one time, a number that has now ballooned
to fifteen with the continuing growth of the area; and
WHEREAS, in addition to helping further develop the newly established SWAT team, he
went on to join the criminal investigations unit as a detective, work that vivified and formed
Deputy Chief Hinson as an officer; and
