HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 307
By Warner
A RESOLUTION to recognize Jackson Mark Smith on becoming
an Eagle Scout.

of America is one of our finest assets, providing young men and women with an educational
program that contributes significantly to their character development, citizenship training, and
improved mental and physical fitness; and
WHEREAS, the highest rank a Scout can attain in the Boy Scouts of America Scouts
BSA program is that of Eagle Scout, and Jackson Mark Smith, after considerable effort and
diligent preparation, will join the prestigious Eagle Court of Honor on April 12, 2025; and
WHEREAS, his notable record of achievement as a member of Boy Scout Troop 273
includes over fifty merit badges and distinguished volunteer service; and
WHEREAS, Jackson Smith's Eagle project greatly contributed to the betterment of his
community, reflected the true spirit of volunteerism, and proved to be a formidable, yet
attainable, challenge; and
