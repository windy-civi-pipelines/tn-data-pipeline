Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 6
By Oliver
A RESOLUTION to affirm that the American Dream belongs to all
of us.
WHEREAS, the American Dream has been a beacon of hope for generations; and
WHEREAS, the American Dream embodies the ideals of opportunity, prosperity, and
upward mobility, promising that every person should have the chance to achieve what they
themselves define as success and fulfillment through hard work and determination; and
WHEREAS, many today feel as though their American Dream is unattainable; and
WHEREAS, the American Dream belongs to all of us, not just billionaires and multi-
millionaires; and
WHEREAS, our highest accomplishments as a state and nation have been achieved
when we have harnessed the strengths of all people, regardless of their identities, to overcome
our greatest challenges; and
WHEREAS, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is a centuries-old movement deeply
rooted in America's founding principles and its subsequent legacy of civil rights and social
justice efforts aimed at delivering the laws, policies, and initiatives that enable America to live up
to our Constitution's promises; and
WHEREAS, DEI policies, from the 19th Amendment to the 1964 Civil Rights Act to the
Americans with Disabilities Act, among others, reflect the corrective legislative and legal actions
taken across our nation's history to expand and guarantee access to the educational, economic,
and civic obligations and capacities of our nation; and
WHEREAS, DEI principles and policies promote equal access to opportunities, foster an
environment of respect and belonging, and ensure that every individual, regardless of
background, can fully participate in all aspects of society; and

WHEREAS, DEI is essential to creating a society where all individuals are valued, heard,
and included; and
WHEREAS, DEI is based on removing barriers to opportunity so that our merits can
speak for themselves; and
WHEREAS, DEI is committed to widening pathways to the American Dream for every
community so that all people can reap the benefits of shared prosperity in our nation; and
WHEREAS, freedom of speech and expression are fundamental constitutional rights,
protecting the ability of individuals to voice their ideas and opinions without interference,
punishment, or retaliation by the government; and
WHEREAS, anti-DEI activists, politicians, and corporate decision-makers who attempt to
prohibit DEI infringe upon the right of individuals to freely express themselves, diminish the
diversity of perspectives that strengthen our society, and bring themselves into conflict with anti-
discrimination laws; and
WHEREAS, efforts to attack DEI are harmful to the bottom line and health of our
economy; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that the State of Tennessee affirms
its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as an essential foundation for achieving the
American Dream and fostering environments where all individuals have the freedom to be
healthy, prosperous, and safe and the opportunity to realize their full potential.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the State of Tennessee encourages local, state, and
federal policymakers, educational institutions, workplaces, and other organizations to adopt and
uphold DEI principles that promote inclusivity, protect freedom of expression, remove barriers,
and provide equitable opportunities for all individuals to pursue their dreams.
