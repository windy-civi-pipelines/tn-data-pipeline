SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 316
By Campbell
A RESOLUTION to commemorate Myositis Awareness Month,
May 2025.
WHEREAS, residents of the State of Tennessee are among those affected by myositis
and other rare diseases, as nearly one in ten Americans have rare diseases; and
WHEREAS, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (collectively referred to as myositis) are
rare, chronic, autoimmune muscle wasting diseases; myositis often features debilitating muscle
inflammation and other symptoms, including pain, fatigue, and trouble swallowing, and can
result in myositis-associated interstitial lung disease; and
WHEREAS, more research is needed to identify the causes of and modes of treatments
for the myositis group of diseases, which includes anti-MDA5 autoantibody positive myositis,
antisynthetase syndrome, dermatomyositis, juvenile dermatomyositis, immune-mediated
necrotizing myopathy, inclusion body myositis, and polymyositis; and
WHEREAS, because myositis is difficult to diagnose, treatment is often delayed, and
individuals generally experience difficulty finding a healthcare provider with expertise in the
condition; and
WHEREAS, all who suffer with myositis experience reduced quality of life, especially as
no cure has been found, and life expectancy is shortened, especially for those with inclusion
body myositis; women and people of color with all forms of myositis experience particularly
pronounced health disparities; and
WHEREAS, The Myositis Association (TMA) is the leading international patient
advocacy organization serving the myositis community, focusing on patient services, education,
research, and public awareness, so as to achieve a world without myositis; and
