SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 461
By Southerland
A RESOLUTION to commend Cleveland Buchanan Wilson for
exemplary service as a legislative intern.
WHEREAS, each legislative session, this body is pleased to recognize certain persons
who have committed themselves, through their adroit service, to the betterment of the legislative
process; and
WHEREAS, Cleveland Buchanan Wilson is one such individual who has distinguished
himself in his role as a legislative intern for Senator Steve Southerland; Cleveland's work has
resulted in innumerable benefits for the legislators he assisted, Senator Southerland and his
staff, and the General Assembly as a whole; and

juggling two jobs, the exceptional Mr. Wilson never failed to show up with unwavering
enthusiasm and a steadfast commitment to making a meaningful impact for the State of
Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, Cleveland Wilson is known as "Mr. Charger" among his peers, a testament
to his unwavering kindness; no fewer than three entitled borrowers would seek him out multiple
times a day, drawn to his ever-reliable generosity; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Wilson's boundless generosity is truly a sight to behold; with an open
heart, he graciously offered to furnish the newly assigned office with furniture and an espresso
machine; and
WHEREAS, his thoughtfulness shone even brighter when he surprised the secretary in
his office with a brand-new water bottle after hers mysteriously vanished for far too long; and
WHEREAS, when he stepped into the role of secretary for the day, the industrious Mr.
Wilson tackled the office's ancient machinery with gusto; though he managed to jam two

printers in his valiant efforts, he triumphantly replaced one relic that had stood since time
immemorial, leaving the office all the better for his spirited intervention; and

science; this stellar scholar has made the Dean's List for multiple semesters and expects to
graduate in December 2025; and
WHEREAS, the son of Tom Wilson and Mary Kate Wilson, Cleveland is a native of
Greenville, South Carolina, and studied jazz at the city's Fine Arts Center while attending
Greenville High School, from which he graduated in 2016; and
WHEREAS, this extremely gifted young artist began working as a music producer for
Kobalt Music Services in Nashville immediately after graduating from high school, and he
signed a publishing deal with the company when he was only twenty years old; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Wilson was nominated for the Country Music Association Award for
2019 Album of the Year for his work on Thomas Rhett's Center Point Road; and
WHEREAS, he was also nominated for the Dove Award for 2023 Pop/Contemporary
Album of the Year for his contributions to Blessing Offor's My Tribe; and

himself in the sporting world as the 2025 Fantasy Football Champion, with special thanks to
Creighton Wilson for this title; and
