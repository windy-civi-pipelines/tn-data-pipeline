A RESOLUTION to honor canine celebrity and Nashville resident
Doug the Pug.
WHEREAS, it is our privilege to recognize those Tennessee fur friends who have
brought much pride and acclaim to the Volunteer State through their important contributions to
society; and
WHEREAS, one such canine is beloved Nashville resident and global internet icon Doug
the Pug, whose devoted work highlights the power of animals to connect, heal, and inspire; and
WHEREAS, with more than eighteen million collective social media followers, Doug, with
his inventive, adorable costumes, encouraging messages, and celebrity photo-ops with the likes
of Dolly Parton herself, is the most-followed pug on the internet; and
WHEREAS, beyond his digital fame, he exemplifies the spirit of giving through the Doug
the Pug Foundation, a nonprofit that brings joy and comfort to children battling cancer and other
life-threatening conditions through hospital visits from therapy dogs; and
WHEREAS, for his many cultural and civic contributions, Doug was duly honored by
Mayor David Briley, who declared May 20, 2019, "Doug the Pug Day" in Nashville; not only is
May 20th Doug's birthday, it also happens to coincide with National Rescue Dog Day, which
seeks to bring attention to the benefits of adopting a four-legged friend; and
WHEREAS, he has also earned such accolades as the title of Forbes' "Second Most
Influential Pet" and two People's Choice Awards for Animal Star; and
WHEREAS, throughout Doug's many adventures, his devoted owners, Leslie Mosier and
Rob Chianelli, ensure that he remains a cherished family dog and receives lots of treats and
naps in the midst of his busy schedule; and
