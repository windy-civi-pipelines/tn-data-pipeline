HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 585
By Warner
A RESOLUTION to honor the Tennessee Walking Horse
Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association on the
occasion of its ninetieth anniversary.
WHEREAS, in the 1860s, the smooth-riding horses used on farms in the American
South began growing in popularity because of their calm disposition, smooth gaits, and sure-
footedness; and
WHEREAS, possessing a unique four-beat gait, these "Tennessee Pacers" or "Southern
Plantation Walking Horses" were becoming sought after not only in the South, but in other parts
of the country, and the need to organize a breed registry was evident by 1935; and
WHEREAS, a street corner conversation in Lewisburg between former Governor Jim
Nance McCord and Mr. Burt Hunter led to a public meeting in May 1935 for the purpose of
organizing a breed association; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' Association of America (now the
Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and Exhibitors' Association or TWHBEA) was established
on May 11, 1935, in Lewisburg; Mr. Hunter was elected its first president and Governor McCord
its first secretary-treasurer; and
WHEREAS, according to Biography of the Tennessee Walking Horse by Ben A. Green,
the organization of TWHBEA in 1935 was "easily the most essential thing to happen in favor of
the Tennessee Walking Horse," making possible the Tennessee Walking Horse National
Celebration at Shelbyville; and
WHEREAS, in furtherance of its mission to "perpetuate the breed," TWHBEA started a
registration program for the Tennessee Walking Horse; and

WHEREAS, the studbook was closed in 1947 with 114 selected Foundation Sires and
Dams; the Tennessee Walking Horse was recognized as a breed by the federal government in
1950; and
WHEREAS, TWHBEA has now registered over half a million horses in all fifty states and
thirty different countries and represents 6,521 members hailing from all fifty states and
seventeen countries; and
WHEREAS, named for the State where the breed registry started, the Tennessee
Walking Horse has brought fame to the Volunteer State from around the globe and was named
the official State Horse of Tennessee in 2000; and
WHEREAS, versatility has always been a hallmark of Tennessee Walking Horses; their
smooth gaits and equilibrium on our rocky terrain made them popular 160 years ago, and this
all-purpose breed is still popular today; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee Walking Horses' flashy movement makes them stars in the
showring, and the natural characteristics that have been passed down through selective
breeding make them popular for trail riding and sought after as dependable mounts for field
trials; and
WHEREAS, the modern Tennessee Walking Horse also excels in a variety of
competitive disciplines, including dressage, competitive trail riding, extreme cowboy racing,
barrel racing, pole bending, trail obstacle, and many more; and
WHEREAS, headquartered in Lewisburg since its inception, the TWHBEA of today is
steadfast in its mission of registering, promoting, protecting, and preserving the Tennessee
Walking Horse breed by serving as a leader in unifying the industry and providing value to the
diverse interests of an international membership; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
- 2 - 007036
CONCURRING, that we recognize and honor the Tennessee Walking Horse Breeders' and
Exhibitors' Association on the occasion of its ninetieth anniversary and thank the organization's
leadership, employees, and volunteers for their ongoing commitment to the prosperity of the
Tennessee Walking Horse breed and its owners, riders, and enthusiasts.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
