HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 326
By Barrett
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Creek Wood Lady
Red Hawks upon finishing as runner-up in the
TSSAA Division I state girls' bowling tournament.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Creek Wood High School Lady
Red Hawks, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of competitors and truly
worthy of admiration by finishing as runner-up in the TSSAA Division I state girls' bowling
tournament while posting an excellent 22-3 season record; and
WHEREAS, entering the state tournament with a 20-2 record, the Lady Red Hawks
easily bested Rhea County 19-8 to emerge victorious in their quarterfinal match-up and then
defeated Bartlett 15-12 in the semi-final round to reach the championship match; and
WHEREAS, contributing significantly to the Lady Red Hawks' tremendous success were
Riley Akins, Brittany Archuleta, Faith Bellamy, Gracie Blaylock, Amy Burns, Carly Gourley,
Lillian Holland, Gabrielle Mann, Cydnei McIllwain, Mada Stewart, Lillian Waterston, and Emily
Wright; and
WHEREAS, the Lady Red Hawks' superb performance would not have been possible
without the stellar leadership of Head Coach Cassie Wright and assistant coaches Meg Haley,
Casey Patrick, and Scott Wright and the unfailing support of their families, their fans, and their
community; and

lasses not only made possible an outstanding season but also surely bode well for their future
success; and

and applaud the Creek Wood Lady Red Hawks for their exemplary season on the lanes; now,
