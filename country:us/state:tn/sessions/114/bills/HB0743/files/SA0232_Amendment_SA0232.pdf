compensation from creditors for providing debt resolution services to the
consumer;

a licensee shall advise the consumer of the effect, if any, a termination of the consumer's
debt resolution services program would have on a previously negotiated installment
resolution agreement and any pending resolution negotiations. Not later than five (5)
business days following the delivery of the advice, and absent further instruction from
- 13 - 006577

consumer's termination and request that the dedicated account service provider
communicate with the consumer regarding disposition of all funds held in the dedicated
account.

does not owe any further payment to the licensee as of the date the licensee terminates
the agreement, other than for the fees previously earned by the licensee.
Notwithstanding this part, if a consumer refuses to pay any fee to a licensee after the
payment has been earned by the licensee, then the licensee may, upon proper notice to
the consumer in writing, which may be provided electronically, terminate the licensee's
agreement with the consumer immediately.

resolution agreement or other valid contractual agreement between the
consumer and the creditor; and
(4) To the extent that debts enrolled in a service are renegotiated,
resolved, reduced, or otherwise altered individually, the fee or consideration
either:
(A) Bears the same proportional relationship to the total fee for
renegotiating, resolving, reducing, or altering the terms of the entire debt
balance as the individual debt amount bears to the entire debt amount.
