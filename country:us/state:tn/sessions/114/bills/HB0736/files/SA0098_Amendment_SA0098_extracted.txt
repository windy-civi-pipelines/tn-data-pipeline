WHEREAS, transportation is a priority to the State of Tennessee, and depleting revenue
is a vital problem; and
WHEREAS, due to new vehicles becoming more energy efficient, it is taking less gas to
drive the same distance, and therefore, less gasoline tax is being collected; and
WHEREAS, the cost of building and maintaining roads is ever increasing; and
WHEREAS, the State's population is rising and visitors to the State are putting more
people on the road, causing greater wear and tear and affecting resurfacing needs on the
State's roads and bridges; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that alternative sources of funding be established to
supplement the decreases in transportation infrastructure funding due to vehicles becoming
more fuel efficient or using no fuel and due to inflation-related increases in road construction
and maintenance costs; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
