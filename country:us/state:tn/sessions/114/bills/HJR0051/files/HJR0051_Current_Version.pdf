HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 51
By Fritts
A RESOLUTION to seek Almighty God's hand of ever-present
mercy and healing on Tennessee.
WHEREAS, we acknowledge that our national and State founders trusted in the
omnipotent hand of Providence to bless our land and to guide their actions; and
WHEREAS, we recognize that these founders established our nation and our State on
the Judeo-Christian values outlined in the Bible, including the concept that governments are
established by God to protect the rights of the individual and the teachings to "do unto others as
we would have them do unto us" and to love our neighbors as ourselves, and that from these
ideas, the Tennessee Volunteer spirit flows; and
WHEREAS, we understand that only a continued commitment and adherence to these
values and the laws of Nature and Nature's God, coupled with a dedication to our Constitution,
can thwart the forthcoming attacks against our Tennessee way of life; and
WHEREAS, we are thankful that Tennessee has been blessed by Providence with
abundant resources and a prosperity resultant from liberty; and
WHEREAS, we are grateful for the periods of economic stability Tennessee has
enjoyed; and
WHEREAS, despite these blessings, our citizens and neighbors will continue to face
challenges, many of which may not have been seen before in this State or nation; and
WHEREAS, our citizens and neighbors continue to have concerns about the security of
our national borders and attacks on our institutions and way of life; and
WHEREAS, exposing, resisting, and removing corruption from all levels of government
is vital to maintaining liberty for all citizens; and

WHEREAS, human trafficking (slavery) was, is, and forever will be an unacceptable evil
in our State and nation that destroys the lives of thousands, depriving them of their Creator-
endowed rights to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness; and
WHEREAS, acts of criminal violence in our communities are and will remain
unacceptable; and
WHEREAS, the dependence on and the addiction to drugs and alcohol will continue to
overwhelm our government finances, our healthcare and mental health systems, and our law
enforcement resources, adversely affecting workforce productivity and damaging families; and
WHEREAS, a high divorce rate and an expansive need for foster care indicates a
brokenness in Tennessee families; and
WHEREAS, building strong and committed families where the father and mother are
committed to one another, their children, and their community is foundational to a healthy
Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, the suicidal and infanticidal tendencies bombarding our culture from all
directions belie the truth that everyone's life has value because we are created in the image of
God; and
WHEREAS, we know that societies that fail to honor all life cannot survive; and
WHEREAS, throughout our history, our leaders have called people to seek the Creator's
favor and mercy by issuing proclamations like the one issued by John Adams on March 23,
1798:
"As the safety and prosperity of nations ultimately and essentially depend on the
protection and the blessing of Almighty God; and the national acknowledgment of this
truth is not only an indispensable duty which the People owe to Him, but a duty whose
natural influence is favorable to the promotion of that Morality and Piety, without which
social Happiness cannot exist nor the Blessings of a Free Government be enjoyed; and
- 2 - 001701

as this Duty, at all times incumbent, is so especially in seasons of Difficulty or of Danger,
when existing or threatening Calamities, the just Judgments of God against prevalent
Iniquity, are a loud call to Repentance and Reformation…Under these considerations it
has appeared to me that the Duty of imploring the Mercy and Benediction of Heaven on
our Country demands, at this time, a special attention from its Inhabitants"; and
WHEREAS, we recognize our duty to legislate responsibly but also understand that
solving these problems will require the blessing and protection of Almighty God and a unity of
purpose within our communities; and
WHEREAS, we hold that "…except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in
vain" (Ps. 127:1(b)); now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that the period of July 1 through July 31 of each year be recognized as a time
of prayer and fasting in Tennessee.
BE IT FUTHER RESOLVED, that we desire the continued blessing of Almighty God on
Tennessee, recognizing that He, as Creator and the King of all Glory, holds all authority to both
judge and bless nations, states, and peoples.
BE IT FUTHER RESOLVED, that we recognize our sins and shortcomings, both
individually and as a people, and humbly ask His forgiveness.
BE IT FUTHER RESOLVED, that we ask the Lord Jesus to remove corruption, criminal
violence, and addiction from our State and our nation, restore marriages and strengthen
families, and bring about a righteous unity of vision and purpose for all Tennesseans.
BE IT FUTHER RESOLVED, that we ask the Holy Spirit to move within the halls of
government, our classrooms, our businesses, our places of worship, and our homes, bringing

peace, hope, love, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness, temperance, forbearance, and
joy.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we call upon those who are physically able and
spiritually inclined to join with us annually during the month of July in a season of prayer and
fasting, depriving ourselves in order to awaken our hunger for and need of God, humbling
ourselves before Him, asking His forgiveness, and seeking His blessings, grace, and mercy so
that we, our communities, our State, and our nation will be transformed.
