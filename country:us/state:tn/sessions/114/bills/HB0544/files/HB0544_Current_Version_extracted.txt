fees, by suit filed in the circuit or chancery court.

compliance with the terms and conditions of the PILOT agreement or any other
agreement whereby ad valorem taxes are substituted in favor of a PILOT. Such report
must detail the developer-lessees' compliance and noncompliance where applicable,
- 4 - 000647
and its fiscal impact on revenues generated from ad valorem taxes in each city and
county affected by such PILOT.
(l) All PILOT agreements must be reduced to writing and submitted to the chief
executive officer of each jurisdiction in which the property is located and to the
comptroller of the treasury, for review, but not approval. An agreement may be
submitted in advance of its execution but must be submitted within ten (10) days after its
execution. The name of individuals that are parties to the agreement may be obscured
