Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 646
By Butler
A RESOLUTION to commemorate Run for the Wall Week in
Tennessee.
WHEREAS, in May 1989, 115 motorcycles left San Diego, California, to travel to the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, known as "The Wall," located in Washington, D.C., in an effort to
raise awareness about prisoners of war/missing in action (POW/MIA) from all wars; and
WHEREAS, only fifteen of the riders completed what has now become known as "Run
for the Wall," an annual event that empowers participants to "ride for those who can't," promotes
healing among all veterans and their families and friends, calls for an accounting of all prisoners
of war and those missing in action, honors the memory of those killed in action, and supports
our military personnel around the world; and
WHEREAS, the number of Americans unaccounted for has slowly decreased in the past
years, but many families still have not had their closure; therefore, the Run for the Wall rides
strive to keep accountability at the forefront and raise visibility, while also saluting the women
and men who have proudly worn the uniforms of the United States of America's military and the
families who have served alongside them; and
WHEREAS, in every generation, there are courageous Americans who answer the call
to serve in our armed forces; they represent the very best of the human spirit and stand tall for
the values and freedoms we cherish; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we should pay tribute to our service members who
have not returned from the battlefield, stand beside their families, and honor those who are, or
who have been, held captive as prisoners of war; and

communities, veteran memorials, and VA facilities on their route from Ontario, California, to

year's Run for the Wall; and
WHEREAS, the Midway Route of Run for the Wall will stop overnight in Cookeville on
May 18-20, 2025, and the Southern Route will stop overnight in Chattanooga on May 20-21,
2025; and
WHEREAS, Run for the Wall will also visit various Tennessee municipalities, VA
facilities, and veteran memorials along the two routes; and
WHEREAS, we salute the many volunteers and participants who make this such a
special event of remembrance as they continue their mission to raise awareness about
American POWs/MIAs; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we join with our fellow Tennesseans and veterans from across the nation
in commemorating May 13-24, 2025, as Run for the Wall Week and thank the event's
organizers and participants for visiting the Volunteer State on May 18-21, 2025, en route to
Washington, D.C., and Marseilles, Illinois.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
