district loss, having fallen to Sale Creek in the first game of the season; and

where they trounced South Pittsburg 70-27 in the semi-final round and defeated Van Buren
County 56-47 in the final to win the region championship; and
WHEREAS, matching up against Clay County in the sectional game, Copper Basin
emerged victorious by a score of 57-49 to earn entry into the promised land of the Class A state

WHEREAS, Copper Basin relied heavily upon the talent, competitive spirit, and
leadership of junior Alexis Hyatt, who led the Lady Cougars in scoring the last three seasons

good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in
competition while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, the perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent of this group of
young ladies not only made possible an outstanding season but also surely bode well for their
future success; and
