A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Sophie Lu on her

2025 Tennessee delegate to the United States Senate Youth Program, a most befitting honor
that recognizes her commitment to leadership and volunteerism; and
WHEREAS, delegates to the United States Senate Youth Program are nominated by
teachers and principals and then chosen by state departments of education nationwide and the
District of Columbia and Department of Defense Education Activity; Tennessee's delegates
were selected by Commissioner Lizzette Reynolds of the Tennessee Department of Education;
and
WHEREAS, in addition to outstanding leadership abilities and a strong commitment to
volunteer work, the student delegates rank academically in the top one percent among the high
school juniors and seniors in their respective state; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Lu's selection for the United States Senate Youth Program is a
testament to her innate abilities as a leader among her peers; these abilities are further
evidenced by her service as the student representative of the Education Relations Committee in
