A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Fayette-Ware Lady
Wildcats girls' basketball team upon finishing as
runner-up at the 2025 Class 3A, District 14
tournament.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this legislative body should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Fayette-Ware Comprehensive
High School Lady Wildcats girls' basketball team, whose members have proven themselves to
be the fiercest of competitors and truly worthy of admiration by finishing as runner-up at the
TSSAA Class 3A District, 14 tournament; and
WHEREAS, Fayette-Ware relied heavily upon the talent, competitive spirit, and
leadership of a quartet of Lady Wildcats, namely Ke'Miyah Buggs, Victory McKinnie, Morgan
Crutcher, and Jerkiya Jones; and
WHEREAS, the Lady Wildcats' superb performance would not have been possible
without the stellar leadership of Head Coach Marcus Stokes and assistant coaches Keith
Jefferson, Kevin Knight, and Nasheka Lewis and the unfailing support of their families, their
fans, and their community; and
WHEREAS, the members of the Fayette-Ware girls' basketball team epitomize all that is
good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in
competition while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, the perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent of this group of
young ladies not only made possible an outstanding season but also surely bode well for their
future success; and
