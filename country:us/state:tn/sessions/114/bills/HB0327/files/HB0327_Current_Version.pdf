SENATE BILL 503
By Rose
HOUSE BILL 327
By Bulso
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4,
Chapter 1, Part 4, relative to months of
observance.
WHEREAS, next year is the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence, the date upon which Thomas Jefferson wrote that "life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness" are among the unalienable rights of all citizens, and that we choose to honor the
250th anniversary by designating the months of June, July, and August in Tennessee as
months of observance during which these rights will be celebrated; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate to celebrate the right to life during June because it was on
June 24, 2022, that the Supreme Court of the United States decided the case of Dobbs v.
Jackson Women's Health Organization, 597 U.S. 215 (2022); and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate to celebrate the right to liberty during July because it was
on July 4, 1776, that America gained its independence; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate to celebrate the right to pursue happiness during August
because it is during August when school children across Tennessee return to school to prepare
for their futures; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4, Chapter 1, Part 4, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:

Independence, the date upon which Thomas Jefferson wrote that "life, liberty, and the
