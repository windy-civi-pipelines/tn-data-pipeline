Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 698
By Reneau
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate the officers and
members of the new American Legion Post in
Signal Mountain.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause in their
deliberations to pay tribute to those exemplary organizations and their members who give
unselfishly of themselves, their time, and their talents to perpetuate the public good; and
WHEREAS, recently receiving its organizational charter, the newly formed Captain Larry
L. Taylor American Legion Post 293 in Signal Mountain is most assuredly one such
extraordinary group deserving of praise and commendation; and
WHEREAS, the American Legion was established on March 15, 1919, at the American
Club in Paris, France, by members of the American Expeditionary Force who served there
during World War I; and
WHEREAS, the American Legion was chartered by the United States Congress on
September 16, 1919, as a patriotic veterans organization devoted to mutual helpfulness; and
WHEREAS, today, as the nation's largest wartime veterans service organization, the
American Legion brings together a global network of some 1.6 million members and more than
12,000 posts throughout all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, France, Latin
America, and the Philippines; and
WHEREAS, throughout its storied history, the American Legion has worked to better the
lives of veterans and their families. In 1921, the Legion's efforts led to the creation of the U.S.
Veterans Bureau, the forerunner of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and during World War II,
it successfully won passage of its greatest legislative achievement, the Servicemen's
Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the GI Bill; and

Officer Chad Mobley, and Chaplain Richard Baldwin; and
WHEREAS, Legionnaires are proud of their organization and its constant vigilance to
uphold the core values of our nation—liberty, justice, respect, and equality; and
WHEREAS, Legion members have remained true to their founders' vision of a long-
standing commitment to America's veterans, a vision that is consistent with the first rule of
battle, "We will not fail those with whom we serve"; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that the members of this General Assembly should honor
the esteemed members of the newly formed American Legion Post in Signal Mountain; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
