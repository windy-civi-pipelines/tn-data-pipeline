SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 154
By Watson
A RESOLUTION to commend Ivy Academy upon its receipt of the
2024 Charter Champion Award for Community
Impact Project of the Year.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we pay tribute to those educational institutions that, through
the natural talents and unflagging commitment to academic excellence evidenced by their
administration, faculty, staff, and students, have earned prestigious acclaim; and
WHEREAS, Ivy Academy in Soddy Daisy is one such exemplary institution, which
recently earned the 2024 Charter Champion Award for Community Impact Project of the Year
for their Emergency Solar Power Backpacks Project; and
WHEREAS, the Charter Champion Award for Community Impact Project of the Year is
given by the Tennessee Charter School Center to a school, small group, or individual to
recognize exceptional service to an organization, school, or community through innovative
projects designed to positively impact and inspire both educational professionals and students;
and
WHEREAS, for their Emergency Solar Power Backpacks Project, Ivy Academy students,
along with their STEM teacher Jerry Webb, designed, created, and are donating emergency
solar power backpacks to aid in both humanitarian crises and natural disasters; and
WHEREAS, Ivy students designed a prototype of the backpack with a foldable solar
panel, lithium battery, charge controller, and inverter; they then tested the backpack in real-life
scenarios, spending a day learning outside while using the solar power to charge devices like
Chromebooks, phones, and small electronics, confirming comfort, ease of use, and reliability;
