Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 363
By Briggs
A RESOLUTION to honor Specialist Ethan M. Ward and Specialist
Brandon T. Moore, 2025 National Guardsmen of
the Year.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should salute those
extraordinary Tennesseans who, through their remarkable and exceptional efforts, have gone
above and beyond the call of duty by dedicating their lives to protecting the citizens of this State
and nation; and
WHEREAS, Specialist Ethan M. Ward and Specialist Brandon T. Moore of the
Tennessee National Guard's 776th Maintenance Company in Elizabethton were recently
selected to receive the 2025 National Guardsmen of the Year Award for their actions during the
disaster response to Hurricane Helene in Erwin on September 27, 2024; and
WHEREAS, on that fateful day at approximately 1:00 p.m., Specialists Ward and Moore
answered the call for soldiers needed for immediate response to perform high-water rescue at
the Unicoi County Hospital in Erwin; and
WHEREAS, due to Hurricane Helene's impact, the water around the hospital was rising
rapidly, and patients were in need of rescue; while Specialists Ward and Moore were in transit
to Unicoi County Hospital, the torrential rainfall continued, generating flash flooding and causing
large amounts of debris to be swept up in the rising water; and
WHEREAS, the Light Medium Tactical Vehicle they were riding in was struck by debris,
causing it to tip over on the passenger side and fill the cab with water; Specialists Ward and
Moore were able to exit the vehicle and swim to a floating debris pile nearby; and
WHEREAS, while waiting for rescue by first responders, Specialists Ward and Moore
witnessed six people being swept down the Nolichucky River, holding on to debris such as

pipes and other objects from the industrial park upstream; without regard for their personal
safety, they bravely rescued all six civilians from the river and pulled them to safety on the
floating debris pile they were occupying and assured the civilians were safe; and
WHEREAS, Specialists Ward and Moore were then able to gain the attention of first
responders on land and began communicating, by using hand and arm signals, to relay the
civilians' status and coordinate a helicopter rescue, demonstrating exceptional crisis
management skills; and
WHEREAS, when the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter arrived, Specialists Ward and Moore
assisted the flight crew by ensuring that all civilians were hoisted to safety prior to their
extraction; and
WHEREAS, the unwavering courage and decisive actions of these two men in the face
of personal risk exemplify the highest standards of conduct expected of a National Guard
soldier; and
WHEREAS, their heroic dedication to their profession and to the safety of fellow soldiers
and citizens reflects great credit upon themselves and upholds the highest traditions of the
National Guard; and
WHEREAS, Specialists Ethan Ward and Brandon Moore embody the virtues of valor
and service above self, and it is our privilege to recognize them for their heroic actions that
saved the lives of Tennesseans in peril; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor Specialist Ethan M. Ward and Specialist
Brandon T. Moore for their bravery during the disaster response to Hurricane Helene,
