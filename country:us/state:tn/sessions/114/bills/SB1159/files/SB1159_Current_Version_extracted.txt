SENATE BILL 1159
By Akbari
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 41,
Chapter 51, relative to correctional institutions and
inmates.
WHEREAS, data and studies consistently show that fostering connections between
incarcerated persons and their families reduces recidivism, such that regular visitation from
family members to an incarcerated person lowers the likelihood of that person reoffending; and
WHEREAS, families of incarcerated persons often spend hundreds of dollars per month
on travel costs, further marginalizing low-income households and exacerbating economic
disparity; and
WHEREAS, maintaining strong ties between an incarcerated person and that person's
family is shown to improve mental health, provide emotional support, facilitate smoother reentry
into society upon completion of their sentence, and supports the overall notion of effective and
sustainable rehabilitation and reintegration; and
WHEREAS, this state seeks to recognize and honor the importance of family
connections in rehabilitation and to reduce recidivism by supporting this initiative; now,
therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
