HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 589
By Keisling
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the York Agricultural
Institute Dragonettes girls' basketball team upon
finishing as runner-up in the 2025 TSSAA
Division I, Class 2A state tournament.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Dragonettes girls' basketball
team of York Agricultural Institute, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of
competitors and truly worthy of admiration by finishing as runner-up in the 2025 TSSAA Division
I, Class 2A state tournament; and
WHEREAS, entering regional competition as District 5 champions, the Dragonettes
devoured Trousdale County 68-31, roared past Westmoreland 48-12, and walloped Jackson
County 67-44 to claim the Region 3 championship; and
WHEREAS, York Agricultural Institute then proceeded to demolish Pearl-Cohn 62-26 in
the sectional round to gain entry into the promised land of the state tourney for the fourth
straight year; and
WHEREAS, poised for victory in the Class 2A state tournament at MTSU's Murphy
Center, the Dragonettes bested Memphis Business 44-43 in a close quarterfinal match-up and
then easily handled Gatlinburg-Pittman 60-45 in the semifinal round to advance to the final; and
WHEREAS, York Agricultural Institute not only completed the 2024-2025 season as the
second-best team in Class 2A, the team also compiled a remarkable 30-6 record; and
WHEREAS, first-rate ballers Reese Beaty, Cali Franklin, Emma Cooper, and Raylee
Werner were named to the All-Tournament team in recognition of their superior play; and

WHEREAS, York Agricultural Institute's superb performance would not have been
possible without the expert guidance of Head Coach Michael Green and Assistant Coach
Crystal Rich and the unfailing support of the players' families, their fans, and their close-knit
community; and
WHEREAS, the members of the York Agricultural Institute girls' basketball team
epitomize all that is good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of
