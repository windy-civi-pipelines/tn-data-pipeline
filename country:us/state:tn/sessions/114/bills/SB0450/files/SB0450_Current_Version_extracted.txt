center in each judicial district setting the standard for the care of abused children; and

the requirements of a child advocacy center in order to meet funding requirements; and
WHEREAS, we, the members of the General Assembly, find that funding for all child
advocacy centers' contracts has remained stagnant since 1999, resulting in increased pressure
on these centers; and
WHEREAS, collectively, the child advocacy centers served over 32,000 children in 2024
with forensic interviews, victim advocacy, medical exams, and mental health clinical services;
and
WHEREAS, the critical role of child advocacy centers and their staff play an integral role
of bringing help, healing, and hope to thousands of child victims each year; and
