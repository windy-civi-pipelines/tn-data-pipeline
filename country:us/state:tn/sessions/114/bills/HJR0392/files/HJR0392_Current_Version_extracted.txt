HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 392
By Farmer
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Pam Oakes on her
selection as a 2024–2025 Jefferson County
Schools District Level Teacher of the Year and
the Piedmont Elementary School Teacher of the
Year.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause to
specially recognize those outstanding teachers who have devoted their careers to providing the
highest quality education for Tennessee's students; and
WHEREAS, Pam Oakes is one such estimable educator, who has distinguished herself
as a professional of the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Oakes has recently been named a 2024–2025 Jefferson County
Schools District Level Teacher of the Year and the Piedmont Elementary School Teacher of the
Year, most befitting honors that recognize the positive influence she has on so many young
lives; and
WHEREAS, a dedicated fifth-grade science and social studies teacher at Piedmont
Elementary for eighteen years, Mrs. Oakes is an extremely talented and compassionate
educator who continuously strives to refine her teaching methods and support student growth;
her data-driven approach has helped her students achieve remarkable success, including a
TVAAS growth index of 4.97 and a 97th percentile ranking in science statewide; and
WHEREAS, beyond academics, Pam Oakes enjoys incorporating real-world
experiences into her teaching; she and her husband have visited more than thirty national
parks, and she often shares personal stories—whether it is hiking rim to rim in the Grand
Canyon, summiting Half Dome in Yosemite, or experiencing an iceberg lake firsthand—to help
students connect lessons to the world around them; and
