HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 382
By McCalmon
A RESOLUTION to honor the Middle Tennessee Veterans
Support Group on the occasion of its twenty-fifth
anniversary.
WHEREAS, our country was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal safety and concerns to ensure our individual and collective freedom, and the Volunteer
State is especially proud to be the home of so many valiant men and women who have
performed above and beyond the call of duty; and
WHEREAS, the citizens of the Volunteer State have, throughout the years, willingly
forsaken the comforts and securities of inaction by taking up arms against the enemies of this
great nation, risking their lives and leaving their loved ones behind to honorably safeguard the
freedoms and liberties guaranteed to all citizens of these United States and vanquishing those
who threaten our way of life; and
WHEREAS, since its inception twenty-five years ago, the Middle Tennessee Veterans
Support Group has worked to bring together veterans and the community to share information
and knowledge, as well as enjoy the camaraderie that is familiar to those who have served in
the military; and
WHEREAS, in January 2000, General John Frame and his friend Jim McGregor, a
World War II B-24 pilot, reunited and began meeting for lunch; over the years, more veterans
and supporters joined them, and since then, the group has grown to include more than 175
individuals, averaging between forty to fifty people meeting for lunch each week and including
veterans from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Cold War, Desert Storm, the War on Terror,
other conflicts, and peacetime; and
