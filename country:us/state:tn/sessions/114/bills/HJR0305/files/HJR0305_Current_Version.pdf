WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should pay tribute to those citizens who are celebrating
special occasions in their young lives; and
WHEREAS, Caroline Mae Crawford will celebrate her first birthday on April 5, 2025, an
exciting milestone that will mark a full year of joy for her doting family; and
WHEREAS, born on April 5, 2024, at 12:39 p.m., Caroline was a six-pound, thirteen-
ounce, 19.5-inches-long bundle of joy who forever changed the lives of those who welcomed
her for the better; and
WHEREAS, she is named after her paternal great-grandmother, Eda Mae Crawford,
whose love and generosity Caroline's parents pray will be embodied by their little one; and
WHEREAS, the Bible verse dedicated to Caroline by her parents is Psalm 34:4: "I
sought the Lord, and He answered me," and she was dedicated to a life serving Christ at First
Baptist Church Hendersonville in front of her family and friends on September 29, 2024; and
WHEREAS, Caroline Mae Crawford loves her mom and dad, her best friend and dog,
Bella, going to the pool, and watching Tennessee football; she does not like peas quite yet but
loves pasta and steak; and
WHEREAS, in her young life, she has already traveled to seven states, attended a golf
tournament, painted pottery, attended a country music concert at Bridgestone Arena, seen the
Grand Canyon, played in the snow, participated in a Tennessee Volunteers baseball team
national championship parade, and put her toes in the sand on Dauphin Island; and
WHEREAS, Caroline is a joy to be around and a blessing to all who have the good
fortune of knowing her; and
