the average of the five (5) preceding fiscal years; except, that bond issues, federal revenue
sharing proceeds, and surcharges levied pursuant to this part must be excluded from the five-
year average computation. If a local government fails after July 1, 2025, to so appropriate and
allocate at least such average amount for road purposes, then the amount of revenues that
would otherwise be allocable to such local government under this part must be reduced by the
amount of the decrease below such average. The amount of the funds not allocated to the
local government because of the decrease must be allocated to the state highway fund, to be
used by the department of transportation for the improvement of state highways in the local
government's jurisdiction, and the state funds are in addition to the funds otherwise allocated
for improvements in the local government's jurisdiction in that fiscal year.

Section 8:
SECTION 7. This act takes effect July 1, 2025, the public welfare requiring it.
