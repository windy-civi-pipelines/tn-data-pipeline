Middle School Lady Panthers girls' basketball
team upon winning the TMSAA Class AA state
tournament.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Lady Panthers girls' basketball
team of Stone Memorial Middle School, whose members have proven themselves to be the
fiercest of competitors and truly worthy of admiration by winning the 2025 TMSAA Class AA
state tournament; and
WHEREAS, Stone Memorial bested John Trotwood Moore and T.W. Hunter in Area 8
competition; and
WHEREAS, moving on to the sectional round, the Lady Panthers vanquished Upperman
in the semifinals and then defeated E.O. Coffman 44-40 in the final game to advance in their
quest for the state championship; and
WHEREAS, at the TMSAA Class AA state tournament at Stewarts Creek High School,
Stone Memorial demolished Memphis Business Academy 64-28 in their semifinal match-up and
then rolled over Alcoa Middle 53-38 in the title game to claim the crown and bring home the
gold; and
WHEREAS, Stone Memorial's superb performance would not have been possible
without the stellar leadership of Head Coach Ivy Mayberry and the unfailing support of the
players' families, their fans, and their community; and
