impacted by agricultural endeavors and believes preserving farmland and forestland will
provide food security for generations to come.

development and implementation of programs that benefit Tennesseans by preserving
farmland and forestland, including a grant program for conservation easements.
(1) There is established within the general fund a special agency account
to be known as the farmland preservation fund for funds allocated to the
department of agriculture for purposes of this section.
(2) Any unencumbered moneys and unexpended balance of the fund
remaining at the end of a fiscal year does not revert to the general fund but must
be carried forward and maintained until expended in accordance with this
