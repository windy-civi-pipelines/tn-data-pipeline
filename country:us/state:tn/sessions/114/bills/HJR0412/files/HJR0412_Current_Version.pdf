tribute to those students who, through their natural talents and unflagging commitment to
academic excellence, have distinguished themselves in the classroom; and
WHEREAS, Haylie Thurman is one such exceptional student, who was recently named
the Valedictorian of the 2025 graduating class at Hampshire Unit School; and
WHEREAS, through diligent study, steady composure during examinations, and
steadfast commitment of time and talent, Ms. Thurman has achieved outstanding academic
success and joined the ranks of the best and brightest students in Tennessee and our country;
and
WHEREAS, in her remarkable high school career, Haylie Thurman has earned an
exemplary grade point average while participating in numerous extracurricular activities,
including acting as the president of the local HOSA and FBLA chapters, being a senior member
of the Beta Club, and serving as the editor-in-chief of the Yearbook Club; and
WHEREAS, her time at Hampshire Unit School saw her volunteer generously to work in
the school's shirt shop, to organize HOSA blood drives and fundraisers for FBLA, and to run
picture days for the yearbook; and
WHEREAS, apart from her superlative scholastic work, she has already exhibited her
extraordinary industriousness by attending HOSA International conferences twice; and
