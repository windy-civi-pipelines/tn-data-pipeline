(1) Prohibit the public procurement of final products or services from a
foreign adversary company, whether those products or services are sold directly
by the foreign adversary company or through a third-party vendor; and
(2) Authorize the public procurement of products and services from a
company that has operations, affiliates, and subsidiaries in a foreign adversary

(a) Except as provided in subsection (e), a foreign adversary company is
prohibited from bidding on or submitting a proposal for a contract with a state agency or

provide final products or services to a state agency or a political subdivision of this state
that are manufactured or produced by a foreign adversary company under subsection
(a) shall, for the purposes of this section, be considered a foreign adversary company.
The restriction does not apply to products or services which have inputs from a foreign
adversary company but that are not final products of a foreign adversary company.
(c) A state agency or political subdivision of this state shall require a company
that submits a bid or proposal for a contract for goods or services to certify that the
company is not a foreign adversary company as described in subsection (b).
(d) If the commissioner determines that a company has submitted a false
certification under subsection (c) of this section:

of the contract for which a bid or proposal was submitted.

(3) The company shall be prohibited from bidding on a state contract for
sixty (60) months.
(e) Notwithstanding the prohibitions in subsections (a) and (b), a state agency
may enter into a contract for goods or services produced by a foreign adversary
company if:
(1) There is no other reasonable option for procuring the good or service;
and
(2) The contract is pre-approved by the department after a determination
that not procuring the good or service would pose a greater threat to the state
than the threat associated with the good or service itself.
4-56-205.
If any provision of this part or its application to any person or circumstance is
held invalid, then the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the act
that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the
provisions of this part are severable.
SECTION 2. This act takes effect July 1, 2025, the public welfare requiring it.
