WHEREAS, it is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure that a company
sanctioned by an adversarial military power does not gain access to genetic information from
the United States; to combat the heinous practice of forcibly harvesting organs from living
persons for transplant; to bring awareness concerning the People's Republic of China's state-
sanctioned practice of forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience and other vulnerable
persons; and to prevent residents of this State from unknowingly involving themselves in forced
organ harvesting; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of this State to recognize and fully oppose the heinous
practice of forced organ harvesting conducted by the People's Republic of China and the
Chinese Communist Party against prisoners, political dissidents, and other individuals who are
held and abused in violation of their basic human rights within the People's Republic of China;
and
WHEREAS, it is intent of this State to oppose the collection and analysis of genetic
information for use by the military and surveillance state of the People's Republic of China, and
