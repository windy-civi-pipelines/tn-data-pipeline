(a) As used in this section:
(1) "Consecutive system" means a public water system that receives
some or all of the system's finished water from one (1) or more wholesale
systems. Delivery may be through a direct connection or through the distribution
system of one (1) or more consecutive systems; and
(2) "Point-of-entry treatment device" means a treatment device applied to
the drinking water entering a house, building, or complex of buildings under
single ownership for the purpose of reducing contaminants in the drinking water

complex of buildings meets the definition of a public water system under ยง 68-221-703,
then the facility constitutes a consecutive system, and shall monitor the influent and

annual basis, and report the results to the department within fifteen (15) days of the end
of the reporting period.
