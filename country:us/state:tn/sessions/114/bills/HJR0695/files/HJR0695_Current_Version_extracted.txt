HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 695
By Vital
A RESOLUTION to honor 3H Group on the occasion of its twenty-
fifth anniversary.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should recognize those Tennessee businesses that have
a long-standing commitment to providing exceptional service to their customers; and
WHEREAS, one such estimable entity is 3H Group of Chattanooga, which celebrates its
twenty-fifth anniversary this year, a commendable milestone for this remarkable and lauded
business; and
WHEREAS, 3H Group was founded in 2000 by Hiren Desai, Harshad Shah, and
Harshad Naik and has since expanded from its origins as a single hotel to now include nearly
forty properties, multiple brand partners, and a staff of almost 1,000 employees; and
WHEREAS, although the business's initial scope was only in the realm of hospitality, the
capacity of 3H Group has branched into real estate development and hospitality product
manufacturing; in 2022, the company experienced one of its greatest paradigm shifts so far by
partnering with LBA Hospitality, an industry leader in the Southeast; and
WHEREAS, always driven by its namesakes of honesty, hard work, and hospitality, 3H
Group has earned renown within the industry and among customers for its commitment to
excellence in construction and in service, and in addition to working with flagship brands like
Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt, 3H Group has built the first hotels of new national and international
brands, laying strong foundations for businesses that are beginning the same journey as 3H
Group; and
WHEREAS, 3H Group has maintained a familial culture and customer-focused
perspective that have sustained the business amid the tumultuous times of their operation,
particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, and the group's insistence on shared values such as
