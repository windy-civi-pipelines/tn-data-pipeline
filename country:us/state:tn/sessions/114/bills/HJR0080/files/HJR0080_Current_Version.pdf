HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 80
By Leatherwood
A RESOLUTION to designate May 2025 as "National
Hypertension Month" and to advocate for greater
access to innovative therapies.
WHEREAS, hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, affects nearly half of all
adults in the United States and is a leading risk factor for various cardiovascular diseases; and
WHEREAS, hypertension often goes undetected and untreated, leading to severe health
complications, including heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure, and contributing to nearly
500,000 deaths per year in the United States; and
WHEREAS, only about one in four adults in the United States have their hypertension
under control; and
WHEREAS, healthcare costs in the United States associated with hypertension account
for about $131 billion per year, while individuals with hypertension are estimated to face nearly
$2,000 higher annual healthcare expenditures compared to those without hypertension; and
WHEREAS, recent advancements in medical technology have introduced U.S. Food and
Drug Administration-approved renal denervation therapies as a promising treatment for resistant
hypertension, offering hope to patients who do not respond adequately to conventional
treatments; and
WHEREAS, renal denervation therapies have demonstrated clinical and real-world
results in reducing blood pressure and improving cardiovascular outcomes; and
WHEREAS, access to innovative treatments is essential for improving public health and
reducing the burden of hypertension-related complications; and

public about the risks of hypertension and the benefits of early detection and treatment,
including the potential role of renal denervation and other innovative therapies.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we urge the Department of Health to promote best
