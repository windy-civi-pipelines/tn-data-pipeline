HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 93
By Hale
A RESOLUTION requesting actions to reduce the administrative
burden on public schools.
WHEREAS, the administrative burdens placed on local education agencies often
redirect valuable resources, including the time of school staff, from the mission of providing
every student with a high-quality education; and
WHEREAS, the executive branch of state government is uniquely situated to identify
administrative burdens that are duplicative and unnecessary; and
WHEREAS, the legislative branch of state government is uniquely situated to alleviate
administrative burdens; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that the governor, the Department of Education, and appropriate committees of
the General Assembly, as determined by the speaker of the senate and speaker of the house of
representatives, are requested to conduct an examination of ways in which to reduce the
administrative burdens on local education agencies and to submit recommendations to the
General Assembly for making such reductions by December 31, 2025.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the governor is requested to actively solicit the input
of public school parents, teachers, and administrators concerning the reduction of the
administrative burdens on local education agencies and to incorporate such input into the
recommendations submitted to the General Assembly.
