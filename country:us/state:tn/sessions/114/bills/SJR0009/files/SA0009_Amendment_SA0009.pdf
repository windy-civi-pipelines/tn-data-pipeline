A victim may assert the rights enumerated in this section, not as a party, but in
the manner further provided by the General Assembly protecting the victim's right to
standing. The General Assembly has the authority to enact substantive and procedural
laws to further define, implement, preserve, and protect the rights guaranteed to victims
by this section. This section must be interpreted to preserve and protect the rights of all
persons to due process. This section, or any law enacted under this section, does not
create a basis for vacating a conviction. This section does not restrict the powers of the
District Attorney General or the inherent authority of the court.
Other than as provided in the preceding paragraph, this section does not create a
cause of action or claim for damages against the state or a political subdivision of the
state; an officer, employee, or agent of the state or of any of its political subdivisions; or
an officer or employee of the court.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that, in accordance with Article XI, Section 3 of the
Constitution of Tennessee, the foregoing proposed amendment shall be submitted to the people
at the next general election in which a governor is to be chosen, the same being the 2026
November general election, and the Secretary of State is directed to place such proposed
amendment on the ballot for that election.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Clerk of the Senate is directed to deliver copies
of this resolution to the Secretary of State, with this final resolving clause being deleted from
such copies.
