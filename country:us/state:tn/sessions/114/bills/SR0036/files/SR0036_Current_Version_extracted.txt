Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 36
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Kortland Whalum of
Memphis.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those citizens who, through their
extraordinary efforts and artistic contributions, have distinguished themselves as community
leaders of whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy person is Kortland Whalum of Memphis, whose
current work in the theatrical world is a continuing example of his personal excellence and
another monument of talent for his hometown; and
WHEREAS, Kortland Whalum hails from the highly respected Whalum family of
Memphis, the members of which, over four generations, have distinguished themselves time
and again in the fields of music, worship, and public service; and
WHEREAS, rather than attempting to follow the same musical path as his siblings,
Kortland Whalum chose to develop his vocal capacity, and drawn by the magic of the stage, he
began a successful career in theater, starring in Memphis productions of Cats and Raisin; and
WHEREAS, after he returned from college in New York City, New York, to work in the
Memphis theater community, Mr. Whalum also dedicated his time to teaching at the Stax Music
Academy, and he now sits on the board of the Memphis Listening Lab, a nonprofit vinyl record
library; and
WHEREAS, with an ever-expansive creative spirit and impulse, Mr. Whalum released a
neo soul EP in 2021 titled A Love Letter, which featured many of his talented relatives
showcasing their mastery of their particular instruments; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Whalum epitomizes the spirit and commitment to family and community
that are characteristic of a true Tennessean; and

WHEREAS, it is most fitting that the members of this legislative body should pause to

GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor the service of
Kortland Whalum, reflecting on his contributions to music and theater and his enduring legacy of
excellence and service.
