SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 347
By Roberts
A RESOLUTION to recognize and commend Chief Joe Williams of
the White House Community Volunteer Fire
Department.
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we should honor those citizens who have performed
with uncommon devotion and enthusiasm throughout their years of public service; and
WHEREAS, Chief Joe Williams is one such estimable individual, who has served with
distinction for forty-six years as a member of the White House Community Volunteer Fire
Department; and
WHEREAS, early observances of local fires, including a home on his parents' farm
catching fire when he was in kindergarten, influenced Chief Williams's decision to devote his life
as a firefighter; and
WHEREAS, as a boy, he witnessed a neighborhood fire, watched the fire trucks pull in,
and ran over to the scene, where firemen let him help pull the hose; after that, when he heard
fire trucks coming, he waited at the end of his driveway, and the firefighters stopped and picked
him up to go along; and
WHEREAS, when he was eleven years old, he lost his father; it was then that local
firefighters were instrumental in stepping up to serve as father figures in his life; and
WHEREAS, Chief Williams officially began his service to the citizens of White House in
1979, at the age of only sixteen; at that time, he was also working with the local volunteer
ambulance service; and
WHEREAS, during his distinguished tenure, Chief Williams has served in his roles as
Assistant Chief and now Chief with a great deal of pride, always doing his utmost to bring honor,
integrity, and compassionate service to his office; and
