WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this legislative body should pay tribute to an
excellent coach who has helped lead his team to astounding success in athletic competition and
an unprecedented State record; and

championship in 2025, capping a third consecutive undefeated season with a perfect 31-0
record; and
WHEREAS, the Eagles' overall record during this three-peat championship run is an
incredible 96-0; the team's record for the last four years is 118-3; and

tactician, and motivator of young men, and he should be appropriately recognized on this
