WHEREAS, Mr. Gobble put no less effort in his civilian labors; he admirably worked for
Magic Chef, which was acquired by Maytag during his thirty-three-year tenure, and retired into
real estate for several years; and
WHEREAS, his life was most especially marked by the profound and abiding love that
he shared with his cherished wife, Judy Ownbey Gobble, whom he married in 1960, and the
caring compassion that he unflaggingly demonstrated, whether by attending their sporting
events or simply through his comforting presence, made him much beloved by his children,
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Gobble leaves behind an indelible legacy of integrity and probity in
public life, compassion and loyalty in private life, and diligence and dedication in all his chosen
endeavors; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause to
remember the bountiful life of this exceptional public servant and human being; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
