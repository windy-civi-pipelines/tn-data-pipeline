AMEND House Joint Resolution No. 98*
by deleting all language after the caption and substituting:
WHEREAS, many servicemembers have reportedly been unlawfully forced to accept
COVID-19 drugs and anthrax vaccinations; and
WHEREAS, our government has a history of subjecting our servicemembers to
experimental conditions and substances without their consent; and
WHEREAS, our national security and readiness to necessarily conduct war is adversely
impacted by the unlawful administering of drugs and substances or exposures to experimental
conditions. Many injuries are reported to have occurred in our servicemembers from a forced
requirement to accept COVID-19 "vaccinations"; and
WHEREAS, our civilian and military leaders owe both an allegiance to the welfare of the
warfighter and a responsibility to the Republic to ensure rules, regulations, and laws are
followed closely in the administering of health care to our servicemembers; and
WHEREAS, the PACT Act of 2022 expanded the Department of Veterans Affairs
coverage of health care and benefits for veterans to include those exposed to burn pits, Agent
Orange, and other toxic substances; and
WHEREAS, recognizing a potential for generational damage, this law helps us provide
generations of veterans—and their survivors—with the care and benefits they've earned and
deserve. It has been appropriate to recognize other chemical substances of which the
unnecessary and forced exposure has caused damage to our servicemembers and their
families; and

WHEREAS, the Department of Veterans Affairs has historically been slow to respond to
toxic exposures, often leaving the servicemember or veteran exposed with no recourse nor help
for decades; it is incumbent upon our government to care for the wounded and injured warriors;
and
WHEREAS, a group of whistleblowers has asserted that COVID-19 treatments were
issued while the chemicals were only Emergency Use Authorized (EUA). The servicemen and
servicewomen alleged that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has unlawfully administered
EUA products as if they were fully licensed Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
products. Military regulations state service members have a legal right to refuse EUA products;
and
WHEREAS, these whistleblowers contend that the FDA issued approval for Pfizer's
Comirnaty vaccine in August 2021, but that none of the FDA-approved vaccines were available.
FDA documents dated November 2021 state: "In the U.S., there are no licensed vaccines or
antiviral drugs for the prevention of COVID-19." Furthermore, the FDA said the EUA-authorized
Pfizer vaccines were "legally distinct" from the FDA-approved Comirnaty vaccines that were
unavailable for service members in the U.S.; and
WHEREAS, anthrax vaccinations are reported to have been issued to millions of
servicemembers, even at times when the drug was not fully approved; and
WHEREAS, in October 2004, a federal judge ordered the military to stop requiring
anthrax vaccines for U.S. military personnel. In response, the Pentagon halted mandatory
anthrax vaccinations "until further notice," but noted the court did not question the safety or
effectiveness of the vaccine. Tennessee troops were issued anthrax vaccinations in 2004; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we strongly urge the United States Congress to require the Department of
- 2 - 003743

Veterans Affairs to add COVID-19 treatments, conducted under Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA) and before FDA approval was granted, as pre-qualifying for care under the PACT Act.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we also strongly urge Congress to require the
Department of Veterans Affairs to add anthrax vaccinations as qualifying for care under the
PACT Act.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we also urge Congress to conduct a full investigation
and provide a report of the timeline, including the accountable persons who made decisions,
recommendations, and approvals of the decision to require servicemembers to accept the
introduction of these chemicals, with their possible harmful or toxic side effects and outside of
legal and lawful permission, into their bodies.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this resolution be transmitted to
the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the President and the
Secretary of the United States Senate, and each member of the Tennessee Congressional
delegation.
