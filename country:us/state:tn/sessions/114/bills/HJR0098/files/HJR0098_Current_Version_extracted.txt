HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 98
By Fritts
A RESOLUTION to urge the United States Congress to require
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to add
COVID-19 treatments and anthrax vaccinations
as pre-qualifying for care under the PACT Act.
WHEREAS, many servicemembers have reportedly been unlawfully forced to accept
COVID-19 drugs and anthrax vaccinations; and
WHEREAS, our government has a history of subjecting our servicemembers to
experimental conditions and substances without their consent; and
WHEREAS, our national security and readiness to necessarily conduct war is adversely
impacted by the unlawful administering of drugs and substances. Many injuries are reported to
have occurred in our servicemembers from a forced requirement to accept COVID-19
"vaccinations"; and
WHEREAS, our civilian and military leaders owe both an allegiance to the welfare of the
warfighter and a responsibility to the Republic to ensure rules, regulations, and laws are
followed closely in the administering of health care to our servicemembers; and
WHEREAS, the PACT Act expanded the Department of Veterans Affairs coverage of
health care and benefits for veterans to include those exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and
other toxic substances; and
WHEREAS, recognizing a potential for generational damage, this law helps us provide
generations of veterans—and their survivors—with the care and benefits they've earned and
deserve. Since March 5, 2024, it has been appropriate to recognize other chemical substances
of which the unnecessary and illegally forced administration has caused damage to our
servicemembers and their families; and

- 1 -
WHEREAS, the Department of Veterans Affairs has historically been slow to respond to
toxic exposures, often leaving the servicemember or veteran exposed with no recourse nor help
for decades; it is incumbent upon our government to care for the wounded and injured warriors;
and
WHEREAS, a group of whistleblowers has asserted that COVID-19 treatments were
issued while the chemicals were only Emergency Use Authorized (EUA). The officers alleged in
an August 15th memorandum that the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has unlawfully
administered EUA products as if they were fully licensed Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved products. Military regulations state service members have a legal right to refuse EUA
products; and
WHEREAS, although the FDA issued approval for Pfizer's Comirnaty vaccine in August
2021, none of the FDA-approved vaccines were available. FDA documents dated November
2021 state: "In the U.S., there are no licensed vaccines or antiviral drugs for the prevention of
COVID-19." Furthermore, the FDA said the EUA-authorized Pfizer vaccines were "legally
distinct" from the FDA-approved Comirnaty vaccines that were unavailable for service members
in the U.S.; and
WHEREAS, anthrax vaccinations are reported to have been issued to millions of
servicemembers, even at times when the drug was not fully approved; and
WHEREAS, in October 2004, a federal judge ordered the military to stop requiring
anthrax vaccines for U.S. military personnel. In response, the Pentagon halted mandatory
anthrax vaccinations "until further notice," but noted the court did not question the safety or
effectiveness of the vaccine. Tennessee troops were issued anthrax vaccinations in 2004; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
- 2 - 002832
CONCURRING, that we strongly urge the United States Congress to require the Department of
Veterans Affairs to add COVID-19 treatments, conducted under Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA) and before FDA approval was granted, as pre-qualifying for care under the PACT Act.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we also strongly urge Congress to require the
Department of Veterans Affairs to add anthrax vaccinations as qualifying for care under the
PACT Act.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we also urge Congress to conduct a full investigation
and provide a report of the timeline, including the accountable persons who made decisions,
recommendations, and approvals of the decision to require servicemembers to accept the
introduction of these chemicals, with their possible harmful or toxic side effects and outside of
legal and lawful permission, into their bodies.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this resolution be transmitted to
the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the President and the
Secretary of the United States Senate, and each member of the Tennessee Congressional
delegation.
