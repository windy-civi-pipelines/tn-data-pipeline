SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 342
By Southerland
A RESOLUTION to honor Totianya Zamora Moore upon winning
the 2024-2025 Tennessee Association of School
Librarians Bookmark Contest.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those young Tennesseans who, through
their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as emerging leaders of whom we can
all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary young person is Totianya Zamora Moore, who recently
won the 2024-2025 Tennessee Association of School Librarians Bookmark Contest; and
WHEREAS, Totianya Moore is a fourth-grade student and one of the more than 150
entrants who submitted an original design to the contest, which saw contestants create a
bookmark with the theme of "Reading is Magical at your School Library"; and
WHEREAS, the designs were judged by illustrator Cindy Knox according to creativity,
commitment to the year's theme, and material usage, and Ms. Moore, competing successfully in
the intermediate division, secured first-place honors; and
WHEREAS, her school librarian, Nikita Stephens, will receive 200 bookmarks with Ms.
Moore's design, as well as a poster copy of the same, and the Tennessee General Assembly
will receive copies to be distributed to school librarians from across the state at this year's
Tennessee Association of School Librarians conference; and
WHEREAS, the intellectual aptitude, ambition, and character displayed by Totianya
Moore surely bode well for her future success; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Moore's dedication to excellence is clearly deserving of our respect,
admiration, and commendation; now, therefore,
