HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 111
By Miller
A RESOLUTION relative to corporations that discontinue their
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs.
WHEREAS, while recent attacks on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs and
initiatives have cynically branded such efforts as "radical and wasteful," nothing could be farther
from the truth; and
WHEREAS, DEI policies reflect the corrective legislative and legal actions taken across
our nation's history to expand and guarantee access to the educational, economic, and civic
obligations and capacities of our nation; and
WHEREAS, DEI principles and policies promote equal access to opportunities, foster an
environment of respect and belonging, and ensure that every individual, regardless of
background, can fully participate in all aspects of society; and
WHEREAS, DEI is essential to creating a society in which all individuals are valued,
heard, and included; and
WHEREAS, DEI is based on removing barriers to opportunity so that our merits can
speak for themselves; and
WHEREAS, DEI is committed to widening pathways for every community, so that all
people can reap the benefits of shared prosperity in our nation; and
WHEREAS, recent attacks upon DEI are harmful to the bottom line and the health of our
economy, as companies that embrace DEI operate both more efficiently and more humanely;
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that it is the sense of this legislative body that American corporations

discontinuing their Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs will suffer a negative impact
on their revenues, as American consumers will pursue other options to purchase goods and
services from companies that are committed to DEI.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we strongly urge and encourage all American
corporations and other American institutions to uphold DEI principles that promote inclusivity,
protect freedom of expression, remove barriers, and provide equitable opportunities for all
individuals to pursue their dreams.
