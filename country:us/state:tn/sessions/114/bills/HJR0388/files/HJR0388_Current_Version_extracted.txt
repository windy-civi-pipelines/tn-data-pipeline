HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 388
By Terry
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Bayker Blankenship
for his rising success in country music.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause to
specially recognize those native Tennesseans who possess world-renowned musical ability and
have achieved early success in the music industry; and
WHEREAS, Bayker Blankenship is one of those noteworthy people, a rising country
music artist known for his high-energy performances, authentic storytelling, smooth vocals, and
undeniable stage presence; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Blankenship, a determined young man from Livingston in Overton
County, has achieved extraordinary success early in his career as a country music artist; he
represents this State by defying the odds to become a successful country music singer in a
short amount of time, demonstrating that a young man from a small town can achieve early
success in the country music industry; and
WHEREAS, Bayker Blankenship got his big break on April 19, 2024, when he released
his second single, "Maxed Out," which reached the No. 2 position on the Spotify Viral Charts
and No. 43 on Apple Country; "Maxed Out" ultimately earned an RIAA Certified Gold Single
award on February 6, 2025; and
WHEREAS, the RIAA Certified Gold Single honor is awarded to a song or album that
sells 500,000 units, and "Maxed Out" has been streamed over 67 million times; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Blankenship recently released his debut album, Younger Years, which
includes the singles "Maxed Out," "Tennessee Sunset," "Young Wild Free," and "Back When
We Were Kids"; the album debuted with more than four million streams in the first week of its
release; and

WHEREAS, in a contest being held throughout his Maxed Out tour, Bayker Blankenship
is donating $1 of every ticket sold to support debt relief, with proceeds going toward helping two
fans pay off their debts; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Blankenship has now garnered over forty million streams in a few
months, opened up for country music legend Willie Nelson on October 19, 2024, in Corpus
Christi, Texas, and appeared on CBS Saturday Morning Saturday Sessions on November 30,
2024; and
WHEREAS, against all odds, Bayker Blankenship has risen from being a small-town
young man with dreams of becoming a successful country music singer to becoming a beacon
of hope for aspiring country musicians in Tennessee and across the nation; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we commend Overton County native Bayker Blankenship for his rapid rise
to stardom as a country music artist, congratulate him upon his first single, "Maxed Out,"
