excellence, have distinguished themselves as leaders in the classroom and beyond; and

one of the two delegates to represent Tennessee in the 2025 United States Senate Youth
Program, an honor that reflects her exceptional leadership, academic achievements, and
commitment to public service; and

based program that brings together two outstanding high school students from each state and
the District of Columbia to gain a deeper understanding of the federal government and its
processes; and
WHEREAS, in addition to outstanding leadership abilities and a strong commitment to
volunteer work, the student delegates rank academically in the top one percent of their states
among high school juniors and seniors; and

remarkable dedication and achievement as a leader among her peers, including serving as
