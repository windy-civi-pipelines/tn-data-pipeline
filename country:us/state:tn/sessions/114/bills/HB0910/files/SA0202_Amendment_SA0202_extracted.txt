place of business, or another chancery court or circuit court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) In an action under subsection (a), the court may issue a permanent or

plaintiff actual damages sustained by the plaintiff, and the legal costs incurred by the
plaintiff that include a reasonable fee for the plaintiff's attorneys of record, all of which
are in addition to other remedies contained in this chapter.

If the plaintiff satisfies this burden, the burden is then on the defendant to produce
evidence that one (1) or more legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons existed for the
challenged employment action. The burden on the defendant is one of production and
not persuasion. If the defendant produces such evidence, the presumption of
discrimination or retaliation raised by the plaintiff's prima facie case is rebutted, and the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the reason given by the defendant was
not the actual reason for the challenged employment action and that the stated reason
was a pretext for illegal discrimination or retaliation. Such allocations of burdens of proof
apply at all stages of the proceedings, including motions for summary judgment. The
plaintiff, at all times, retains the burden of persuading the trier of fact that the plaintiff has
been the victim of intentional discrimination or retaliation.

service credit, and seniority, wherever applicable, as of the date of their leave.
(2) Employees who are prevented from giving three (3) months' advance
notice because of a medical emergency that necessitates that leave begin earlier
than originally anticipated do not forfeit their rights and benefits under this section
solely because of their failure to give three (3) months' advance notice.

benefits, plans, or programs during the period of such leave, unless the employer
so provides for all employees on leaves of absence.

the employee has worked part time or full time for another employer during the
period of leave, then the employer is not liable under this section for failure to
reinstate the employee at the end of the leave.

(b) An individual employee or agent of an employer is not liable for a civil
violation an employer of such person is found to have committed under this section.
(c) A person or a member or representative of the person who willfully resists,
prevents, impedes, or interferes with the performance of a duty or the exercise of a
power by the attorney general or the attorney general's agent in connection with this
chapter commits a Class C misdemeanor.
4-21-311. Private right of action.
(a) A person injured by an act in violation of this chapter has a private right of
action in chancery court or circuit court in a county in which the alleged violation
occurred, in a county in which a respondent resides or has the respondent's principal
place of business, or another chancery court or circuit court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) In an action under subsection (a), the court may issue a permanent or
temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or another order and may award
plaintiff actual damages sustained by the plaintiff, and the legal costs incurred by the
plaintiff that include a reasonable fee for the plaintiff's attorneys of record, all of which
are in addition to other remedies contained in this chapter.
(c) In cases involving discriminatory housing practices, the court may award
punitive damages to the plaintiff, in addition to the other relief specified in this section
and this chapter.
- 31 - 002841

(d) A civil action brought pursuant to the private right of action under this section
must be filed in chancery court or circuit court within one (1) year after the alleged
discriminatory practice ceases.
(e) In a private right of action alleging a violation of this chapter, the plaintiff has
the burden of establishing a prima facie case of intentional discrimination or retaliation.
If the plaintiff satisfies this burden, the burden is then on the defendant to produce
evidence that one (1) or more legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons existed for the
challenged employment action. The burden on the defendant is one of production and
not persuasion. If the defendant produces such evidence, the presumption of
discrimination or retaliation raised by the plaintiff's prima facie case is rebutted, and the
burden shifts to the plaintiff to demonstrate that the reason given by the defendant was
not the actual reason for the challenged employment action and that the stated reason
was a pretext for illegal discrimination or retaliation. Such allocations of burdens of proof
apply at all stages of the proceedings, including motions for summary judgment. The
plaintiff, at all times, retains the burden of persuading the trier of fact that the plaintiff has
been the victim of intentional discrimination or retaliation.

An employee shall not concurrently maintain a cause of action in state court
under § 4-21-401, § 8-50-103, or § 50-1-304, while at the same time prosecuting an

the employer, the state court shall dismiss an action maintained under § 4-21-401, § 8-
50-103, or § 50-1-304, in which the employee is concurrently prosecuting an action
based on a common nucleus of operative facts in federal court.

employee benefit plan, such as a retirement, pension, or insurance plan, that is
not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this chapter, except that no such

employee benefit plan must excuse the failure to hire an individual, and no such
seniority system or employee benefit plan must require or permit the involuntary
retirement of an individual who is at least forty (40) years of age because of the

firefighter or a law enforcement officer and the individual has attained the
age of hiring or retirement in effect under applicable state or local law on
March 3, 1983; and

subterfuge to evade this chapter.
(2) As used in this subsection (e), unless the context otherwise requires:

leave, and their intention to return to full-time employment after leave, must be
restored to their previous or similar positions with the same status, pay, length of
service credit, and seniority, wherever applicable, as of the date of their leave.
(2) Employees who are prevented from giving three (3) months' advance
notice because of a medical emergency that necessitates that leave begin earlier
than originally anticipated do not forfeit their rights and benefits under this section
solely because of their failure to give three (3) months' advance notice.

notice because the notice of adoption was received less than three (3) months in

benefits, plans, or programs during the period of such leave, unless the employer
so provides for all employees on leaves of absence.

liable under this section for failure to reinstate the employee at the end of the
leave period.

adoption, pregnancy, childbirth, and nursing the infant, where applicable;
therefore, if an employer finds that the employee has utilized the period of leave
to actively pursue other employment opportunities or if the employer finds that
the employee has worked part time or full time for another employer during the
period of leave, then the employer is not liable under this section for failure to
reinstate the employee at the end of the leave.

filled temporarily or because the employee has used the leave to pursue
employment opportunities or to work for another employer, the employer shall
notify the employee.

(1) Affect a bargaining agreement or company policy that provides for
greater or additional benefits than those required under this section;

immigration status, then the employee does not have a cause of action for discrimination
based on national origin for the discharge under this part.
