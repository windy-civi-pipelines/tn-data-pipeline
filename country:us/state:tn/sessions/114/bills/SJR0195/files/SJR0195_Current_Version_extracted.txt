afterschool program; and
WHEREAS, an avid proponent for a socioemotional approach that caters to the whole
person of a student, Ms. Blevins always desires to integrate academics, community, and
extracurriculars, and while instilling that same love into those she guides and trains, she helps
colleagues achieve greater success by helping to formulate individualized educational plan
goals, complete reevaluation paperwork, and create resources that better facilitate student
learning; and
WHEREAS, among Ms. Blevins's most cherished accomplishments was her
collaboration at Unicoi County Middle School with the late Sharon Slagle to create the
"Imagination Station Pre-K Parade" that united middle school and Pre-K students to foster a
cohesive school culture and identity; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Blevins also commits her time, along with her sons, to the Handbell

to the church's Vision Team; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Blevins truly serves as an inspiration to the faculty, staff, and students
at Love Chapel Elementary School, and her friendship and counsel are highly valued by those
who are fortunate to know her; and
