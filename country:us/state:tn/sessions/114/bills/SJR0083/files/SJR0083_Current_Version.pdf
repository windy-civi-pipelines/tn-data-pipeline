SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 83
By Massey
A RESOLUTION to commemorate February 22, 2025, as George
Washington Day in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, George Washington, the Founding Father of the United States of America,
was born on February 22, 1732; through his unwavering dedication and exceptional leadership,
George Washington earned his place as the "Father of our Country"; and
WHEREAS, over two centuries ago, George Washington was appointed Commander-in-
Chief of the Continental Army; without pay and with steadfast resolve, he led a diverse and
untested army through eight and one-half years of war, culminating in American victory against
British forces; and
WHEREAS, his leadership at pivotal moments, including the crossing of the Delaware
River and the triumph at Yorktown, remains a testament to his courage and strategic brilliance;
and
WHEREAS, George Washington established the supremacy of civilian authority over the
military when, in 1783, he quelled a mutiny among unpaid soldiers and voluntarily resigned his
commission; he returned to private life at Mount Vernon, setting a global precedent for selfless
public service; and
WHEREAS, as president of the Constitutional Convention, George Washington provided
steady guidance as delegates drafted the U.S. Constitution, advancing the rule of law and the
ideals of liberty and justice; and
WHEREAS, unanimously elected as the first president of the United States, he
established enduring principles of governance and set an example of humility and dedication to
republican ideals by voluntarily stepping down after two terms, ensuring the peaceful transfer of
powerâ€”a cornerstone of American democracy; and

WHEREAS, George Washington modeled religious freedom, as demonstrated in his
Letter to the Touro Synagogue, and recognized the moral contradiction of slavery, freeing those
he enslaved upon his death as an acknowledgment of its incompatibility with the ideals of the
republic; and
WHEREAS, upon George Washington's death on December 14, 1799, at his beloved
home of Mount Vernon, President John Adams declared, "His example is now complete, and it
will teach wisdom and virtue to magistrates, citizens, and men, not only in the present age, but
in future generations, as long as our history shall be read."; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee's residents are encouraged to honor George Washington's
legacy by visiting Mount Vernon, which provides invaluable educational opportunities, including
teachers institutes that equip educators to share his story and ideals with future generations;
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we commemorate February 22, 2025, as George
Washington Day in Tennessee and encourage all citizens to reflect on and celebrate the
enduring contributions of George Washington to the founding and preservation of our nation.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
