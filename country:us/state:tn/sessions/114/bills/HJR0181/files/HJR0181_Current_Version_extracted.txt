Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 181
By Clemmons
A RESOLUTION to recognize and honor Carol Westlake on the
occasion of her retirement.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause to
specially recognize those estimable Tennesseans who have dedicated themselves to improving
the quality of life for their fellow citizens; and
WHEREAS, Carol Westlake is one such individual, who, after thirty-five devoted years of
service, is taking her well-deserved retirement from the Tennessee Disability Coalition (TDC),
an organization she founded and ably stewarded as executive director; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Westlake founded the TDC, then known as the Coalition for Community
Services, in 1987 and officially became the organization's executive director on November 1,
1990; what began as an informal, four-person cohort of disability advocates has grown, due in
large part to Ms. Westlake's efforts, into a thriving, leading voice within the halls of the General
Assembly and across the Volunteer State; and
WHEREAS, the TDC is now a 501(c)3 nonprofit alliance of more than forty member
organizations and individuals who promote the full and equal participation of people with
disabilities in all aspects of life, advocating collectively for self-determination, independence,
empowerment, and inclusion through various programs and public policy; and
WHEREAS, a lifelong advocate for children and adults with disabilities, Ms. Westlake
has helped to establish a number of disability advocacy programs and agencies in Tennessee
and helped pass laws to protect the rights of Tennesseans with disabilities; and
WHEREAS, in her years at the helm of TDC, she had a profound impact on Tennessee
public policy that affects Tennesseans with disabilities; a core value that guided her work in her
decades-long advocacy on issues like voting, education, employment, health care, and housing

was the right and ability of all individuals to make choices about their own lives based on their
individual wants and needs; and
WHEREAS, apart from her impact on legislation in Tennessee, Ms. Westlake has been
tapped for her expert counsel by the administrations of six U.S. presidents, five Tennessee
governors, eight Metro Nashville mayors, and countless other State, county, and business
leaders; and
WHEREAS, she has been duly recognized for her good work over the years, receiving
the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) Justice for All Disability Rights
Award, the organization's highest honor, for her extraordinary leadership in support of the
economic and political empowerment of all people with disabilities; other recipients of this honor
include Ted Kennedy, Orrin Hatch, John McCain, and Bob Dole; and
WHEREAS, Carol Westlake also received the 2024 Linda O'Neal Lifetime Achievement
Award from the Tennessee Commission on Children and Youth; in addition to being a respected
leader in the disability advocacy community in Tennessee and throughout the country, she has
served as a mentor and teacher for the next generation; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Westlake's legacy with the TDC is an exemplar for effective leadership:
identifying an unmet need or unrealized goal, sharing it with others to get buy-in, and building a
coalition to achieve it; and
WHEREAS, throughout her tenure as executive director of the TDC, Ms. Westlake has
carried out her responsibilities with diligence and integrity; and
WHEREAS, her remarkable success as a public servant and civic leader has been
directly attributable to her reliance on the time-honored values of hard work and common sense
and her uncommon ability to work well with people from all walks of life; and

WHEREAS, an unwavering advocate for individuals with disabilities in Tennessee, Ms.
Westlake has compiled a singular record of success during her exemplary career, and she
should be specially recognized; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we recognize and honor Carol Westlake on the occasion of her retirement
as executive director of the Tennessee Disability Coalition, extending our best wishes for every
future success and happiness.
