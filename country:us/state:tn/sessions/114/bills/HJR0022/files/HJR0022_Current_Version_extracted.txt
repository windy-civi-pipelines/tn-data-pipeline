HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 22
By Clemmons
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of John Richard "Dick"
Lodge, Jr., of Nashville.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of John Richard "Dick"
Lodge, Jr., a longtime General Assembly lobbyist and friend to many on Capitol Hill; and
WHEREAS, born in Sewanee on June 16, 1949, Dick Lodge was the son of Reverend
John Richard Lodge and Sarah Virginia "Pat" Lodge; he traveled with his family a great deal
during his youth, from Alabama to Alaska, ultimately graduating from Escambia County High
School in Atmore, Alabama; and
WHEREAS, after graduating from the University of the South (Sewanee) in 1971, he
earned his Juris Doctor degree from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1974, thereafter
working in the State Attorney General's Office for two years, at which time he joined the
campaign to elect Jim Sasser to the U.S. Senate, which ultimately proved successful; and
WHEREAS, Dick Lodge accompanied Senator Sasser to Washington, D.C., to become
his first legislative director, a fortuitous endeavor, as it was there that he met his future wife,
Gina, who was working for Senator Patrick Moynihan; and
WHEREAS, Dick and Gina Lodge married in 1978 and returned to Nashville for Mr.
Lodge to join the law firm of Willis and Knight; during his early years in private practice, he
become known as a phenomenal chef, which owed much to his family's background in the cast
iron skillet business and his wife's encouragement; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Lodge was elected to serve as Tennessee Democratic Party chair in
1983; he headed the committee of Southern States to create Super Tuesday during his five-
year tenure, before joining Bass, Berry & Sims, where he became a partner and headed the
firm's first Government Relations practice area; and

service to his community extended to include serving as senior warden at Christ Church
Cathedral, president of Legal Services of Middle Tennessee, and an early supporter of Thistle
Farms; and
WHEREAS, above all, Dick Lodge was wholly devoted to his friends and his family,
always endeavoring to remain true to family values of the highest order; and
WHEREAS, he is survived by his beloved wife of forty-six years, Virginia "Gina" Tyler

life, compassion and loyalty in private life, and diligence and dedication in all his chosen
