HOUSE RESOLUTION 111
By Behn
A RESOLUTION to honor Duke's on the occasion of the
establishment's tenth anniversary.
WHEREAS, it is our privilege to recognize those businesses and their proprietors who
not only contribute to the economic well-being of this State but also serve as beacons in their
communities, cultivating an environment of good will and good times; and
WHEREAS, Duke's, a vital commercial member of the bustling Five Points community in
East Nashville, was founded in 2015; ten years later, Duke's still abides by its original no-
nonsense philosophy of serving reasonably priced food and drinks to 206ers and tourists from
Inglewood and Madison alike; and
WHEREAS, Duke's specializes in delicious New York-style deli sandwiches that are
freshly prepared and served fifteen hours each day, from lunch to late, late night; and
WHEREAS, Duke's is owned and operated by local rock 'n' rollers, so unsurprisingly, the
psych, punk, and soul jams the bar pumps out around the clock are some of the best in Music
City; and
WHEREAS, Duke's spins a wide variety of vinyl most every night, courtesy of a revolving
collective of DJs that includes regulars with stellar collections, local musicians, touring bands,
obsessive record collectors, and frequent special guests; and
WHEREAS, on April 19, 2025, Duke's celebrates its tenth anniversary with musicians
performing live, DJs spinning vinyl, and the crowd yelling for more; and
WHEREAS, whether a patron is there for the drinks, food, music, or even the vibe,
Duke's is always a great hang, and this thriving establishment is worthy of our recognition on
this special occasion; now, therefore,
