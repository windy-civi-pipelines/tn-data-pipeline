HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 179
By Sparks
A RESOLUTION to recognize the mental health consequences of
social media on K-12 students.
WHEREAS, the mental health crisis among young people has reached alarming levels,
with rising rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, particularly since the early 2010s; and
WHEREAS, Jonathan Haidt's The Anxious Generation identifies key contributors: the
proliferation of smartphones and social media, the decline of unstructured play, and the rise of
overprotective parenting; policymakers have a crucial role in reversing these trends by
implementing regulations and policies that support healthier childhood development; and
WHEREAS, research shows a strong correlation between excessive screen time and
declining mental health in adolescents, and social media platforms use engagement-driven
algorithms that expose youth to harmful content, fostering anxiety and depression; and
WHEREAS, policymakers should enact laws and regulations that: (1) set age restrictions
on social media use, similar to existing regulations for tobacco and alcohol; (2) require social
media companies to provide age-appropriate settings and limit algorithm-driven content for
minors; and (3) introduce digital well-being curricula in schools to educate youth on healthy
technology habits; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Haidt's work also recognizes that free play is essential for building
resilience, social skills, and emotional intelligence, yet it has drastically declined due to over-
scheduling and safety concerns, and overregulation of play spaces and excessive adult
intervention limit children's opportunities for real-world learning; and
WHEREAS, policymakers at both the state and local levels should: (1) reassess and
reduce unnecessary regulations on play spaces to encourage more free play in communities;
(2) incentivize schools and municipalities to create play-friendly environments, including outdoor

recess requirements; and (3) promote awareness campaigns on the benefits of independent
play for children's development; and
WHEREAS, additionally, excessive risk aversion in parenting has led to children lacking
autonomy and problem-solving skills, and overregulation and parental fears limit youth
opportunities for independence and decision-making; and
WHEREAS, state lawmakers should: (1) support parental education programs that
encourage age-appropriate independence; (2) encourage "Let Grow" initiatives that promote
walking to school, outdoor play, and self-directed activities; and (3) reform liability laws that
discourage schools and communities from allowing free play; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we recognize the mental health consequences of social media on K-12
students and support efforts to address this issue in the State of Tennessee.
