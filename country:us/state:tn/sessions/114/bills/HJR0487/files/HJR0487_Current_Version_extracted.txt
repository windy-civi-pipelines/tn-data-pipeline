HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 487
By Clemmons
A RESOLUTION to welcome Tennessean Captain Barry "Butch"
Wilmore back to Earth after completing his
mission aboard the International Space Station.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly take great pleasure in recognizing
an astronaut who served the disciplines of aeronautics and space flight with distinction and
demonstrated his devotion to his country and his mission during his more than nine-month stay
aboard the International Space Station (ISS); and
WHEREAS, after nearly 300 days in orbit, Captain Barry "Butch" Wilmore and his
colleague, Captain Sunita "Suni" Williams, returned to Earth on March 18, 2025; and
WHEREAS, departing from Earth as a member of the Boeing's Starliner's first crewed
mission, Captain Wilmore arrived at the ISS in June 2024 for a scheduled short stay as part of
its test flight; however, technical issues prevented him and Captain Williams from returning
home on the spaceship; and
WHEREAS, NASA decided to keep Captain Wilmore at the ISS for a few extra months
to maintain staffing levels, later launching the SpaceX Crew-9 mission with only two astronauts,
instead of the usual four, to provide Captain Wilmore and his colleague with a ride back home;
and
WHEREAS, the average person would probably not relish spending more than nine
months in space, but Captain Wilmore enjoyed his extra time in the cosmos, modestly referring
to his extended stay as "just part of the job"; and
WHEREAS, in the early morning of March 18, 2025, Captain Wilmore and Captain
Williams boarded the SpaceX Dragon at the ISS to return to Earth; after a seventeen-hour
voyage, the Dragon made a water landing off the Florida coast that evening; and

U.S. Navy captain and a veteran of two spaceflights; he has accumulated more than 8,000 flight
hours and 663 carrier landings; and
WHEREAS, Captain Wilmore is to be greatly commended for his dedication to duty in
the face of adversity; this brave astronaut served an extended stay in space without complaint
or compunction, and he is worthy of our approbation upon his return home; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
