HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 519
By Russell
A RESOLUTION to recognize Officer Robert A. Jackson, Jr., on
the occasion of his retirement.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal concerns to ensure the public safety and welfare, and the Volunteer State is especially
proud to be the home of so many valiant individuals; and

Capitol Police, who, having rendered sterling service to the people of the State of Tennessee for
more than thirty years, will soon take his much-deserved retirement; and

Enforcement Training Academy, and the Nashville Airport Authority; and
WHEREAS, eager to serve his country, Officer Jackson entered the United States Air

Academy, marking the start of his military career; and

Officer Jackson completed seven years of a six-year term of enlistment in 1991; and
