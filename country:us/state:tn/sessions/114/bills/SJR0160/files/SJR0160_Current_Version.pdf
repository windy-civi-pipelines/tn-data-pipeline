SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 160
By Watson
A RESOLUTION relative to the renaming of the Gulf of America
and Mount McKinley.
WHEREAS, in an executive order dated January 20, 2025, President Donald J. Trump
restored the name of Mount McKinley, citing President William McKinley's leadership in our
victory in the Spanish-American War and the "rapid growth and prosperity, including an
expansion of territorial gains for the Nation" during his administration; and
WHEREAS, in that same executive order, President Trump renamed the continental
shelf area bounded on the north by the U.S. and extending to the seaward boundary with two
other nations as the Gulf of America, citing the Gulf's "pivotal role in shaping America's future
and the global economy" and recognizing the Gulf as a "flourishing economic resource … [of]
critical importance to our Nation's economy and its people"; and
WHEREAS, in an executive order dated February 9, 2025, President Trump designated
that very day as the first ever Gulf of America Day to restore "American pride in the history of
American greatness" during the early days of his administration; and
WHEREAS, we most heartily agree with President Trump that "the naming of our
national treasures … should honor the contribution of visionary and patriotic Americans in our
Nation's rich past"; and
WHEREAS, the renaming of these two natural treasures should be appropriately
referenced in our schools; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that this General Assembly encourages Tennessee's
