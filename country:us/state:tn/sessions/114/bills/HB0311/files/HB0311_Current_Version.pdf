sextort, sexually exploit, traffic, and sexually manipulate individuals who are subject to a
conservatorship; and
WHEREAS, there are estimated to be one million ninety-one thousand people living in
conditions of modern slavery in the United States. This equates to three and three tenths
victims for every one thousand people in the country; and
WHEREAS, a 2022 investigation into violence by the Autism Research Institute found
that seventy-five and four tenths percent of participants out of one hundred ten people reported
sexual harassment, and almost sixty percent reported experiences of sexual violence compared
to fifty-six and four tenths percent and twenty-eight and two tenths percent reported by non-
autistic participants; and
WHEREAS, like the general population, female autistic individuals are at higher risk for
experiencing sexual victimization and violence. An online survey by the Autism Research
Institute found that as many as nine autistic women out of every ten have experienced sexual
violence, where seventy-five percent of the two hundred twenty-five study participants reported
that their first experience occurred during childhood or adolescence; and
WHEREAS, suicide rates in autistic individuals range from eleven percent to sixty-six
percent and significantly more premature deaths are caused by suicide in autistic individuals
