HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 510

A RESOLUTION to recognize Trinity Tabernacle Church of God in
Christ on the occasion of its fifty-ninth
anniversary.
WHEREAS, the churches of our nation have been an integral part of our history as a
people and have had an unparalleled impact in forming and maintaining a stable and just
society; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we should recognize those venerable religious
institutions and their congregations that, through their unflagging capacity for love, dedication of
spirit, and faith in God, strive to enrich the lives of people in their communities; and
WHEREAS, one such dynamic community of faith is Trinity Tabernacle Church of God in
Christ in Knoxville, whose members will celebrate the church's fifty-ninth anniversary on April
27, 2025; and
WHEREAS, Trinity Tabernacle Church of God in Christ was birthed from the merger of
three Holiness Church families: Grace Tabernacle, New Life-Emmanuel, and Trumpet in Zion;
and
WHEREAS, Grace Tabernacle, the Mother Church of Trinity, was birthed in the living
room of Mother Talitha Ellison, in the Mechanicsville community of Knoxville, in September
1966, under the leadership of Elder Harold J. Bell; and
WHEREAS, after several moves as membership increased, Grace Tabernacle relocated
to 2615 Washington Avenue in East Knoxville; for the first time in the history of Grace
Tabernacle, a beautiful edifice was built to the honor and glory of God, later to become Trinity
Tabernacle Church of God in Christ; and
