HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 262
By Parkinson
A RESOLUTION to honor Shelly Rice for his outstanding
leadership with the Frayser Exchange Club.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should specially
recognize those estimable public servants who have dedicated themselves to improving the
quality of life for their fellow citizens; and
WHEREAS, Shelly Rice, who provided effective leadership to the Frayser Exchange
Club for some twenty years, has always evidenced the greatest integrity and humility in his
chosen endeavors in service to that community; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Rice was one of a handful of citizens who revived the Frayser Exchange
Club in the early 2000s in an effort to keep the sprawling twenty-square-mile neighborhood
civically engaged; and
WHEREAS, under his leadership, the Frayser Exchange Club became an important
representative of the community, garnering regular attendance among community members and
fostering civic participation and cooperation among people of different political affiliations, a
remarkable achievement in these divisive times; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Rice inspired the resilient residents of Frayser to engage in building a
club where people could come together to find solutions to community problems through civic
discourse; and
WHEREAS, the dedicated efforts of Mr. Rice and the other members of the Frayser
Exchange Club were instrumental in the construction of a new Frayser high school, a new
Frayser public library, and the new Ed Rice Community Center, named in honor of Shelly Rice's
father, where the Frayser Exchange Club now meets; and

WHEREAS, feeling the Frayser Exchange Club needed new blood and new
perspectives, Mr. Rice humbly relinquished his leadership post in January 2025 to Pastor Mike
Ellis; and
WHEREAS, throughout his exemplary tenure with the Frayser Exchange Club, Shelly
Rice has proven himself to be wholly committed to the noble precepts of public service that
have earned Tennessee recognition as the Volunteer State, and he is most deserving of our
approbation on this special occasion; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend Shelly Rice for his outstanding leadership with the
Frayser Exchange Club for twenty years, praise his work in motivating civic engagement across
the political divide, and extend to him our best wishes for much continued success and
happiness in his future endeavors.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
