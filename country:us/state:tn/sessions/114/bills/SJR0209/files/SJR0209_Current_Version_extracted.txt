Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 209
By Johnson
A RESOLUTION to recognize Zachary Greathouse on becoming
an Eagle Scout.
WHEREAS, at a time when this nation's youth face difficult challenges, the Boy Scouts
of America is one of our finest assets, providing young men and women with an educational
program that contributes significantly to their character development, citizenship training, and
improved mental and physical fitness; and
WHEREAS, the highest rank a Boy Scout can attain in the Boy Scouts of America
Scouts BSA program is that of Eagle Scout, and Zachary Greathouse, after considerable effort
and diligent preparation, has joined the prestigious Eagle Court of Honor; and
WHEREAS, Zach's remarkable future success was already signaled during his time in
Cub Pack 298, where he earned the Arrow of Light; and
WHEREAS, his notable record of achievement as a member of Boy Scout Troop 16
includes twenty-three merit badges, the National Outdoor Award for Camping, the 50-Miler
Award for hiking, and distinguished service, culminating in the 122 volunteer hours required for
his Eagle project, the construction of park benches that could convert to picnic tables for an
outdoor break area at The Well Food Pantry's second location in Mt. Pleasant, which greatly
contributed to the betterment of his community and reflected the true spirit of volunteerism; and
WHEREAS, he excelled as a leader among his peers through his attendance at the
Troop Leadership Program and the National Youth Leadership Training and his assistance of
nine of his fellow Scouts in their Eagle projects; and
WHEREAS, Zach's intrepidity and indomitable spirit always led him to greater
adventures, and his time with the Boy Scouts is marked by summer and winter camps, hiking,
canoeing, climbing, and the high adventure trek at Philmont Ranch in New Mexico; and

band for four years, a period that also saw him performing with the Southwind Drum and Bugle
Corps and Music City Drum Corps, and he currently performs in two musical ensembles and the

one of the most outstanding young people in our State; now, therefore,
