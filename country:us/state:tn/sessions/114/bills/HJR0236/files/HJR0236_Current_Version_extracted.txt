Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 236
By Faison
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Parrottsville Parrotts
boys' basketball team upon winning the Cocke
County Elementary Basketball Tournament.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lads is the Parrottsville Parrotts boys'
basketball team, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of competitors and
truly worthy of admiration by winning the Cocke County Elementary Basketball Tournament
back-to-back (2024 and 2025); and
WHEREAS, in the championship game of the 2025 tournament, the Parrotts trailed 16-9
at halftime but turned on the jets in the second half to defeat Cosby by a score of 35-30 and
bring home the gold; and
WHEREAS, the Parrotts claimed the 2025 regular season championship in the large
school division in addition to winning their second consecutive Cocke County Elementary
Basketball Tournament; and
WHEREAS, Parrottsville thus completed an amazing three-year span in which the team
posted two consecutive undefeated seasons and compiled a remarkable 53-4 record; and
WHEREAS, the Parrotts's superb performance would not have been possible without the
stellar leadership of Coach Danny Hartsell and the unfailing support of their families, their fans,
and their community; and
WHEREAS, John Dillon Ramsey, Abe Kickliter, and Braelyn Talley of Parrottsville were
named to the All-Tournament team; and

WHEREAS, the members of the Parrottsville boys' basketball team epitomize all that is
good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in
competition while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, the perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent of this group of lads
not only made possible a championship season but also surely bode well for their future
success; and
WHEREAS, the Parrottsville Parrots have enjoyed success that other teams can only
hope to mimic, and it is fitting that we should acknowledge and applaud their outstanding
season on the hardwood; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend the members and coaches of the Parrottsville
Parrotts boys' basketball team upon winning the Cocke County Elementary Basketball

every continued success in all their future endeavors.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
