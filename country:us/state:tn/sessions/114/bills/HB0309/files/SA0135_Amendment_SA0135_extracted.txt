legal representation for eligible claimants in appeals of veterans' disability benefit claims.
Under the program, the department shall contract with a private law firm to represent
claimants as described in this section.
(b) The representation available under this program is limited to claimants who
have had an appeal of a claim for veterans' benefits remanded by the United States
court of appeals for veterans claims to the board of veterans' appeals or other
appropriate veterans administration of the United States authority for further
proceedings. The department shall notify an eligible claimant of the opportunity to
receive representation through the contracted law firm. Participation by eligible
claimants is voluntary.
(c) The agreement between the department and the private law firm shall not
obligate the state to pay any fees or expenses. The contracted firm shall bear all costs

costs, or case expenses under the contract.

(d) The contracted law firm's sole compensation for representing a claimant
under this program is a contingent fee paid out of any benefits recovered for that
claimant. The fee must be an amount agreed upon in the attorney-client fee agreement
and be consistent with federal regulations. If no monetary benefits are awarded, the firm
shall not receive a fee. The firm shall not charge the claimant any retainer, hourly fee, or
other compensation, and shall only receive the contingent percentage if the claim is
successful.
(e) The contracted firm is responsible for all reasonable case-related expenses
incurred during representation, including, but not limited to, filing fees, obtaining medical
records, expert opinions, and travel expenses. The contracted firm may seek
reimbursement for expenses solely in connection with the contingent fee from benefits
awarded, to the extent such inclusion is allowed by law, and shall not require upfront
payment of any expense by the claimant. If the representation does not result in a
benefit award, the claimant is not responsible for any expenses incurred by the
contracted firm during representation.
(f) A claimant is not required to accept representation through the contracted law
firm. An eligible claimant who opts to use the contracted firm's services must consent in
writing and enter into a representation agreement with the firm. Nothing in this section
diminishes or replaces existing services available to claimants through the department.
(g) The department shall ensure that any law firm contracting under this section
has an office located in this state with a primary practice focusing on veterans' benefits
law, has at least ten (10) years of experience representing claimants before the United
States department of veterans affairs in claims for compensation, has a principal owner
or practice group leader that has entered appearances at the United States court of
appeals for veterans' claims, and that its attorneys representing claimants under this

Section 3:
section are accredited by the United States department of veterans affairs.
