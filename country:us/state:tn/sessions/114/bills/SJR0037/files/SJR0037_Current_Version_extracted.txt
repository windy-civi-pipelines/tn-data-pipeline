Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 37
By Lamar
A RESOLUTION to designate October 17 as Maternal Health Day
in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, Maternal Health Day celebrates every person's right to respectful, quality,
safe, and comprehensive maternal health care, including women of color, rural and urban
women, and women living below the poverty line; and
WHEREAS, a significant percentage of all pregnancies worldwide are affected by life-
threatening but preventable complications; adolescents are at significant risk for maternal
complications, with maternal deaths ranking as a leading cause of death for girls aged fifteen to
nineteen; and
WHEREAS, women need integrated, evidence-based, and cost-effective care before,
during, and after pregnancy, as women die from complications in pregnancy or childbirth
because their healthcare system lacks resources and/or its allocation of health resources
overlooks women's needs; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee's maternal mortality rate is significantly higher than the national
average; and
WHEREAS, Maternal Health Day seeks to raise awareness of the importance of
maternal health and promote skilled and dignified care for all women; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we designate October 17 as Maternal Health Day in
Tennessee in support of all women, including women of color, rural and urban women, and
women living below the poverty line.
