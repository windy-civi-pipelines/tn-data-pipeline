(a) Upon issuance of an extreme risk protection order pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367,
including a temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order, the court shall order the
respondent to surrender to the local law enforcement agency all firearms and
ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
- 12 - 003048
possession, except as provided in ยง 39-17-1370, and any handgun carry permit issued
under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366, held by the respondent.
(b) The law enforcement officer serving an extreme risk protection order issued
pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367, including a temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order,
shall request that the respondent immediately surrender all firearms and ammunition
owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or possession and any
handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366, held by the
respondent. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms and
ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession and any handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366,
held by the respondent, which are surrendered. Alternatively, if personal service by a
law enforcement officer is not possible or is not required because the respondent was
present at the extreme risk protection order hearing, then the respondent must surrender
all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody,
control, or possession and each handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง
39-17-1366, held by the respondent, in a safe manner to the control of the local law
enforcement agency immediately after being served with the order by service or
immediately after the hearing at which the respondent was present. A law enforcement
officer may seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to conduct a
search for firearms or ammunition owned or held by the respondent if the officer has
probable cause to believe that there are firearms or ammunition in the respondent's
custody, control, or possession that have not been surrendered.
(c) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of a
firearm or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control,
or possession, or a handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366,
- 13 - 003048
held by the respondent shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms and the quantity and
type of ammunition that have been surrendered, and any permit surrendered, and shall
provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within seventy-two (72) hours after
service of the order, the law enforcement officer serving the order shall file the original
receipt with the court and shall ensure that the officer's law enforcement agency retains
a copy of the receipt.
(d) Upon the sworn statement or testimony of any person alleging that the
respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms or ammunition as
required by an order issued pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367, the court shall determine whether
probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms
or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession. If the court finds that probable cause exists, then the court must issue a
warrant describing the firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent
and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms or ammunition owned or
possessed by the respondent are reasonably believed to be found and the seizure of
firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent discovered pursuant to
the search.
(e) If a person other than the respondent claims title to firearms or ammunition
surrendered pursuant to this section and the person is determined by the law
enforcement agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or ammunition, then the
firearm or ammunition must be returned to the person, if:
(1) The lawful owner agrees to store the firearm or ammunition in a
manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the
firearm or ammunition; and
- 14 - 003048
(2) The firearm or ammunition is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by
the owner.
(f) Upon the issuance of an extreme risk protection order, the court shall order a
new hearing date and require the respondent to appear no later than three (3) business
days after the issuance of the order. At the hearing, the court shall require proof that the
respondent has surrendered all firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent or in
the respondent's custody, control, or possession. The court may cancel the hearing
upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in compliance with the order.
(g) All law enforcement agencies must develop policies and procedures
regarding the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, ammunition, or licenses
required to be surrendered under this section.
39-17-1369.
(a) If an extreme risk protection order issued pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367 is
vacated or ends without extension, then a law enforcement agency holding a firearm or
ammunition owned by the respondent or a handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-
1351 or ยง 39-17-1366, held by the respondent, that has been surrendered or seized
pursuant to an extreme risk protection order must return the surrendered firearm,
ammunition, or permit, as requested by a respondent only after confirming through a
background check that the respondent is currently eligible to own or possess firearms
and ammunition under federal and state law and after confirming with the court that the
extreme risk protection order has been vacated or has ended without extension.
(b) If an extreme risk protection order is vacated or ends without extension, then
the department of safety, if the department has suspended a handgun carry permit
issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366 pursuant to the entry of an extreme risk
protection order under ยง 39-17-1367, must reinstate the permit only after confirming that

(c) A law enforcement agency must provide notice to each family or household
member of the respondent before returning a surrendered firearm and ammunition
owned by the respondent.

vacate the extreme risk protection order must be disposed of pursuant to ยง 39-17-1317.
39-17-1370.
A respondent in an action pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367 may elect to transfer all
firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent that have been surrendered to or
seized by a local law enforcement agency pursuant to the extreme risk protection order
to another person who is willing to receive the respondent's firearms and ammunition.
The law enforcement agency shall allow such a transfer only if it is determined that the
chosen recipient:
(1) Currently is eligible to own or possess a firearm and ammunition
under federal and state law after confirmation through a background check;
(2) Attests to storing the firearms and ammunition in a manner such that
the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearms and
ammunition until the extreme risk protection order against the respondent is
vacated or ends without extension; and
(3) Attests not to transfer the firearms or ammunition back to the
respondent until the extreme risk protection order against the respondent is
vacated or ends without extension.

carry permit, then the department must immediately suspend the permit.
(d) If an extreme risk protection order is vacated before its end date, the clerk of
the court shall, on the day of the order to vacate, forward a copy of the order to the

copy, the sheriff shall verify receipt with the sender before attempting to serve it

original service of documents pursuant to subdivision (l)(1) must be certified by
the clerk of the court and delivered to the parties at the time of the entry of the
order. The parties may acknowledge receipt of such order in writing on the face

The hearing must occur no sooner than fourteen (14) days and no later than
thirty (30) days after the date of service of the request upon the petitioner.
(3) The respondent has the burden of proving by clear and convincing
evidence that the respondent does not pose a significant danger of causing
personal injury to the respondent or others by having in the respondent's custody
or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm or ammunition. The

circumstances since entry of the order and stating the reason for the requested
extension.

that it deems appropriate, up to twelve (12) months.
39-17-1368.
(a) Upon issuance of an extreme risk protection order pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367,
including a temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order, the court shall order the
respondent to surrender to the local law enforcement agency all firearms and
ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
- 12 - 003048

possession, except as provided in ยง 39-17-1370, and any handgun carry permit issued
under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366, held by the respondent.
(b) The law enforcement officer serving an extreme risk protection order issued
pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367, including a temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order,
shall request that the respondent immediately surrender all firearms and ammunition
owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or possession and any
handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366, held by the
respondent. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms and
ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession and any handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366,
held by the respondent, which are surrendered. Alternatively, if personal service by a
law enforcement officer is not possible or is not required because the respondent was
present at the extreme risk protection order hearing, then the respondent must surrender
all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody,
control, or possession and each handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง
39-17-1366, held by the respondent, in a safe manner to the control of the local law
enforcement agency immediately after being served with the order by service or
immediately after the hearing at which the respondent was present. A law enforcement
officer may seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to conduct a
search for firearms or ammunition owned or held by the respondent if the officer has
probable cause to believe that there are firearms or ammunition in the respondent's
custody, control, or possession that have not been surrendered.
(c) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of a
firearm or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control,
or possession, or a handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366,
- 13 - 003048

held by the respondent shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms and the quantity and
type of ammunition that have been surrendered, and any permit surrendered, and shall
provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within seventy-two (72) hours after
service of the order, the law enforcement officer serving the order shall file the original
receipt with the court and shall ensure that the officer's law enforcement agency retains
a copy of the receipt.
(d) Upon the sworn statement or testimony of any person alleging that the
respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms or ammunition as
required by an order issued pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367, the court shall determine whether
probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms
or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession. If the court finds that probable cause exists, then the court must issue a
warrant describing the firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent
and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms or ammunition owned or
possessed by the respondent are reasonably believed to be found and the seizure of
firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent discovered pursuant to
the search.
(e) If a person other than the respondent claims title to firearms or ammunition
surrendered pursuant to this section and the person is determined by the law
enforcement agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or ammunition, then the
firearm or ammunition must be returned to the person, if:
(1) The lawful owner agrees to store the firearm or ammunition in a
manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the
firearm or ammunition; and
- 14 - 003048

(2) The firearm or ammunition is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by
the owner.
(f) Upon the issuance of an extreme risk protection order, the court shall order a
new hearing date and require the respondent to appear no later than three (3) business
days after the issuance of the order. At the hearing, the court shall require proof that the
respondent has surrendered all firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent or in
the respondent's custody, control, or possession. The court may cancel the hearing
upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in compliance with the order.
(g) All law enforcement agencies must develop policies and procedures
regarding the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, ammunition, or licenses
required to be surrendered under this section.
39-17-1369.
(a) If an extreme risk protection order issued pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367 is
vacated or ends without extension, then a law enforcement agency holding a firearm or
ammunition owned by the respondent or a handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-17-
1351 or ยง 39-17-1366, held by the respondent, that has been surrendered or seized
pursuant to an extreme risk protection order must return the surrendered firearm,
ammunition, or permit, as requested by a respondent only after confirming through a
background check that the respondent is currently eligible to own or possess firearms
and ammunition under federal and state law and after confirming with the court that the
extreme risk protection order has been vacated or has ended without extension.
(b) If an extreme risk protection order is vacated or ends without extension, then
the department of safety, if the department has suspended a handgun carry permit
issued under ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366 pursuant to the entry of an extreme risk
protection order under ยง 39-17-1367, must reinstate the permit only after confirming that
- 15 - 003048

the respondent is currently eligible to have a handgun carry permit issued under ยง 39-
17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366.
(c) A law enforcement agency must provide notice to each family or household
member of the respondent before returning a surrendered firearm and ammunition
owned by the respondent.
(d) A firearm and ammunition surrendered by a respondent pursuant to ยง 39-17-
1368 that remains unclaimed by the lawful owner for one (1) year after an order to
vacate the extreme risk protection order must be disposed of pursuant to ยง 39-17-1317.
39-17-1370.
A respondent in an action pursuant to ยง 39-17-1367 may elect to transfer all
firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent that have been surrendered to or
seized by a local law enforcement agency pursuant to the extreme risk protection order
to another person who is willing to receive the respondent's firearms and ammunition.
The law enforcement agency shall allow such a transfer only if it is determined that the
chosen recipient:
(1) Currently is eligible to own or possess a firearm and ammunition
under federal and state law after confirmation through a background check;
(2) Attests to storing the firearms and ammunition in a manner such that
the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearms and
ammunition until the extreme risk protection order against the respondent is
vacated or ends without extension; and
(3) Attests not to transfer the firearms or ammunition back to the
respondent until the extreme risk protection order against the respondent is
vacated or ends without extension.

and similar state databases. The order must remain in each system for the period stated
in the order, and the law enforcement agency may only remove an order from the

crime information center and similar state databases constitutes notice to all law
enforcement agencies of the existence of the order. The order is fully enforceable in
each county in this state.
(c) The issuing court shall, within three (3) business days after issuance of an
extreme risk protection order or temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order,
forward all available identifying information concerning the respondent, along with the
date of order issuance, to the department of safety. Upon receipt of the information, the
department shall determine if the respondent has a handgun carry permit issued
pursuant to ยง 39-17-1351 or ยง 39-17-1366. If the respondent does have a handgun
carry permit, then the department must immediately suspend the permit.
(d) If an extreme risk protection order is vacated before its end date, the clerk of
the court shall, on the day of the order to vacate, forward a copy of the order to the
department of safety and the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order
to vacate. Upon receipt of the order, the law enforcement agency shall promptly remove
- 17 - 003048

the order from any computer-based system in which it was entered pursuant to
subsection (b).
39-17-1372.
(a) A person who makes a false statement under oath in a hearing held pursuant
to ยง 39-17-1367 in regard to a material matter commits perjury under ยง 39-16-702.

affect the ability of a law enforcement officer to remove a firearm or ammunition or
handgun carry permit from a person or to conduct a search and seizure for firearms or
ammunition pursuant to other lawful authority.
