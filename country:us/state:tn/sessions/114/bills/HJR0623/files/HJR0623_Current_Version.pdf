HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 623
By Lynn
A RESOLUTION to recognize Williamson Chapel CME Church on
the occasion of its 175th anniversary.
WHEREAS, the churches of our nation have been an integral part of our history as a
people and have had an unparalleled impact in forming and maintaining a stable and just
society; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we should recognize those venerable religious
institutions and their congregations who, through their unflagging capacity for love, dedication of
spirit, and faith in God, strive to enrich the lives of people in their communities; and
WHEREAS, one such dynamic community of faith is that of Williamson Chapel Christian
Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church in Wilson County, whose members will celebrate the
church's 175th anniversary this year; and
WHEREAS, Williamson Chapel CME Church is located in one of the oldest Black
American communities in West Wilson County, known as the Needmore community, on land
that was at one time part of one of the larger plantations in the State of Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, between 1840 and 1850, the Mastman family gave an acre of land to be
used to construct both a church and a school for Needmore community residents; the deed was
registered in the name of Williamson Chapel CME Church trustees Cal Gordon, husband of
Lizzie Williamson (daughter of Richard and Chaney Williamson), Hiram Williamson (brother of
Richard Williamson), Joe Johnson, Jessie Parker, and John Horton; and
WHEREAS, after eight generations, the present-day descendants of Richard and
Chaney Williamson continue to reside in the Needmore community and surrounding areas; and
WHEREAS, around 1896, the old log church was torn down, and an oblong frame
building was erected a few feet from the original edifice; the new structure had no foundation,

was supported on stilts, and had no electricityâ€”kerosene lamps were hung on the walls inside
for lighting, and two large potbelly coal stoves were used as sources of heat; and
WHEREAS, over the years, the church has benefited from the inspired leadership of
several ministers, including Reverend A.J. Parker, Reverend A.H. Jenkins, Reverend D.R.
Wiles, Reverend W.R. Potter, Reverend E. Wiley, and Reverend D.L. Wein; and
WHEREAS, in 1936, Reverend John H. Britton was assigned to Williamson Chapel, and
during his tenure with the church, which lasted until his retirement in 1961, he was a mentor to
those throughout the community and brought overall renewal to the church; under his
leadership, the building was reconstructed using stone, electricity was installed, and the
church's first choir was instated; in the 1960s, a choir room and a pastor's study were added to
the rock structure, and electric heat was eventually installed; and
WHEREAS, ministers after Reverend Britton include Reverend Clarence Bagwell,
Reverend Frank Hudson, Reverend Dr. Solomon Shannon, Reverend Wiley Hatchett, Reverend
George Coleman, Jr., Reverend Raymond Sommerville, Sr., Reverend T.R. Crosslin, and
Reverend Frederick L. Braddock, Sr.; and
WHEREAS, in 1984, Reverend George W. Coleman was assigned to Williamson Chapel
CME Church; under his leadership, the congregation experienced great spiritual and physical
growth, and the church purchased its first parsonage, organized its first library, and held its first
retreat. Reverend Coleman's efforts to preserve the two-room school built near the church in
1936 are today continued by the Williamson Chapel Historic Committee; and
WHEREAS, in 1989, Reverend Frederick Braddock was assigned to Williamson Chapel;
the church continued to grow under his leadership, and new ministries were organized and
implemented, including the male chorus, missionary choir, and men's fellowship. Strong
emphasis was placed on children and youth ministry, and several youth organizations were
organized, such as the children and youth choirs and the Leaders of Tomorrow; and

WHEREAS, Reverend Braddock also oversaw the installation of padded pews, new
windows, full-length glass doors, and new carpet, as well as the addition of a new piano and the
advent of drums during services and renovation of the bathrooms and the parsonage, which
was paid in full; during his tenure, the land and former elementary school were deeded to the
trustees of the church; and
WHEREAS, beginning in July 1998, Reverend Woodrow Harris, Jr., led the church to
expand its program offerings to include tutoring, book club, computer classes, etiquette classes,
field trips for children and seniors, and workshops on CPR, home buying, and personal finance;
he also oversaw the purchase of additional land for church expansion; and
WHEREAS, after a groundbreaking on April 17, 2005, the congregation moved into its
new sanctuary on December 18th of the same year, and the former sanctuary, which was
approved for the National Register of Historic Places, became the expanded multi-purpose
facility; and
WHEREAS, the current pastor of Williamson Chapel CME Church, Reverend Dr. Lynn
Hargrow, Sr., has served in this capacity since July 2012, implementing his vision of training,
educating, and developing a greater awareness and desire for spiritual growth and outreach,
making Williamson Chapel a more purpose-driven church; and
WHEREAS, as the church celebrates 175 years of service, it continues to be a light in
the community, and the devout members of the congregation have faithfully striven to carry out
God's work in the world; and
WHEREAS, Williamson Chapel CME Church is truly one of the great religious
institutions and catalysts for positive spiritual change in our State and nation, and the members
of this exceptional congregation should be appropriately honored for their exemplary service to
their fellow Christians and the good people of Tennessee; now, therefore,
