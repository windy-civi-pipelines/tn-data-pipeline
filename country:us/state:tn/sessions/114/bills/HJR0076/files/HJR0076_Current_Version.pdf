By Hardaway
A RESOLUTION to express support for faith-based recovery
programs.
WHEREAS, substance abuse, addiction, and homelessness are pervasive issues that
affect individuals, families, and communities across the nation, resulting in negative impacts on
health, economic stability, and community well-being; and
WHEREAS, faith-based organizations, through recovery programs, have provided vital
resources and life-transforming support to individuals facing these challenges, helping them
reclaim their lives through spiritual healing, personal accountability, and community
engagement; and
WHEREAS, faith-based recovery programs that focus on promoting spiritual renewal
have demonstrated success in transforming lives through faith, providing comprehensive
services that include shelter, counseling, and long-term rehabilitation; and
WHEREAS, many of these faith-based programs operate independently, relying on
private donations, community support, and volunteer efforts without dependence on government
funding, thereby preserving their mission and values; and
WHEREAS, these faith-based recovery programs have made substantial, positive
impacts in reducing homelessness, lowering recidivism, and fostering lasting recovery and
societal reintegration; and
WHEREAS, supporting these organizations aligns with the values of compassion,
personal responsibility, and community support that strengthen the moral and social fabric of
society; now, therefore,
