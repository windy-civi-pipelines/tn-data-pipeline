A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate the Unity School Lions
boys' basketball team upon winning the TMSAA
Class A state championship.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should pause in its deliberations to
recognize and honor those student-athletes who, through hard work and commitment to
excellence, have attained the highest levels of success in their respective sports; and
WHEREAS, the Unity School Lions boys' basketball team is one such exemplary group
of young men who reached an extraordinary level of success in winning the 2025 Tennessee
Middle School Athletic Association (TMSAA) Class A state championship; and
WHEREAS, the Lions' 42-40 victory against the defending state champions from West
Junior High School in the state final on February 15, 2025, completed a run through a veritable
gauntlet of elite basketball programs, with their impressive 28-2 season record including wins
against the 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 state champions during the sectional and state
tournaments; and
WHEREAS, the team's comeback victory during the state championship game was
emblematic of the remarkable resilience, teamwork, and mental and physical toughness the
Lions displayed time after time during the season; and
WHEREAS, the 2024-2025 Unity Lions won not only the first state championship in the
school's thirty-three-year history but also Lincoln County's first basketball state championship at
any level and first middle school state championship in any sport; and
WHEREAS, the Lions were a true team who placed collective success above all
individual goals, with that focus also providing the opportunity for team members to shine; and

Guthrie all earned recognition on the All-Conference, All-Area, and All-Sectional teams; after

game adjustments, conditioning sessions, and inbounds-play wizardry were the stuff of legend;
and

Bradford, and Athletics Director Jennifer Medley, the Lions have grown not only as leaders on
the basketball court but throughout their community, where they prominently serve in the Unity
Student Council, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Beta Club and are key members of the
baseball, football, Scholars' Bowl, soccer, and tennis teams; and
WHEREAS, the Lions were empowered by remarkable support from their community,
who traveled en masse to every postseason game and filled the gymnasium at the state
tournament in Murfreesboro; and

names into the annals of Tennessee sports history, and the character, perseverance,
