Section 1:
By Capley
SENATE BILL 896
By Walley
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 66,
Chapter 1, relative to real property.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly find that the common law estates of
fee simple determinable, fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and fee simple subject to
executory limitation are ancient concepts, and reverter and forfeiture provisions of unlimited
duration in the conveyance of any interest in real property constitute an unreasonable restraint
on alienation and are contrary to the policy of this State; and
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly find that it is in the best interests of
the citizens of this State that the common law estates of fee simple determinable, fee simple
subject to condition subsequent, and fee simple subject to executory limitation be abolished for
the surety of title to real property; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:

Section 2:

fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and fee simple subject to executory
limitation executed more than seventy-five (75) years prior to July 1, 2025, are abolished

containing the reverter or forfeiture provision.
(2) Notwithstanding subdivision (b)(1), past rights vested in deeds as of
July 1, 2025, are converted to a fee simple absolute at the end of seventy-five
(75) years from the date created unless a sworn statement containing the name
of the current owner of the property, the estate sought to be preserved, and a
description of the property is filed in the register of deed's office of the county in
which the property is located by July 1, 2026, to preserve the right. The sworn
