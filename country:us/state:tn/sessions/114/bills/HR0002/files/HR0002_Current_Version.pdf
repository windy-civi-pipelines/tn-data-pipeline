HOUSE RESOLUTION 2
By Glynn
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Clarksville Area Urban
Ministries.
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that the members of this legislative body should recognize
those venerable religious organizations that, through their unflagging capacity for love,
dedication of spirit, and faith in God, enrich the lives of people in their communities; and
WHEREAS, Clarksville Area Urban Ministries is one such entity, which operates the only
winter warming shelter in Clarksville for citizens experiencing homelessness; and
WHEREAS, located in the gym at Madison Street Methodist Church, the warming shelter
has served the Clarksville community as a temporary solution for unhoused citizens seeking to
escape frigid temperatures and winter weather; and
WHEREAS, Deborah Ashcraft operates the warming shelter as a part of Clarksville Area
Urban Ministries; shelter volunteers collaborate to meet the basic needs of individuals, and the
shelter, on average, accepts at least twenty new clients each month; and
WHEREAS, with the help of the community, the shelter's presence was publicized, and a
new bus stop was added to create a direct line of transportation to the facility; and
WHEREAS, Clarksville Area Urban Ministries stands on the rock-solid foundation of
Christian belief, service, and love, serving as a bastion of faith and outreach to the people of its
community and beyond; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should pause to recognize such an exemplary
organization; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor and
