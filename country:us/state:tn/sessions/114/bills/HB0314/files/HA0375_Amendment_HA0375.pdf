SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 29-13-106, is amended by deleting
subsection (h) and substituting:
(h)
(1) The maximum award pursuant to subsection (e) is equal to one
hundred five percent (105%) of the national average of the maximum
compensation award provided by the fifty (50) states within the United States, the
District of Columbia, and the United States Virgin Islands, rounded up to the
nearest one hundred dollars ($100).
(2) Beginning January 1, 2026, and on an annual basis thereafter, the
state treasurer shall compare the maximum award limit for this program with the
average of the maximum award limits of the fifty (50) states within the United
States, the District of Columbia, and the United States Virgin Islands. If any of
the states or territories do not have a maximum award limit that is ascertainable
or set in a manner similar to that of this state, then the state treasurer shall
eliminate that state or territory from comparison.
(3) If the maximum award, as determined pursuant to this subsection (h),
decreases from the immediately preceding maximum award determination, then
the state treasurer shall obtain the written approval of the chair of the committee
on finance, ways and means of the senate and the chair of the committee having

to publishing the reduced maximum award. If written approval is not obtained
prior to the May 1 publication date, then the maximum award must not be
decreased.
(4) Notwithstanding another law to the contrary, the state treasurer shall
make an adjustment to the maximum award amount by publishing the adjusted
maximum award on the department of treasury website by no later than May 1 of
the comparison year. An adjustment made pursuant to this section is effective
on July 1 of the comparison year, and applies to claims filed for crimes occurring
on or after that date. The determination and publication of the adjusted
maximum award by the state treasurer is not a rule as defined in ยง 4-5-102, and
such actions of the state treasurer are exempt from the Uniform Administrative
Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5.
(5) By June 30, 2025, the state treasurer shall publish on the department
of treasury website the maximum compensation award determined pursuant to
this section for claims filed for crimes occurring on or after July 1, 2025.
SECTION 2. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
