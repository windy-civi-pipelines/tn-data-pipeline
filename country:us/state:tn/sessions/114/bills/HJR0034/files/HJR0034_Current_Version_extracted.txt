Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 34
By Howell
A RESOLUTION to commemorate March 2025 as "Bleeding
Disorders Awareness Month" in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, hemophilia is a rare genetic condition affecting hundreds of people in
Tennessee, and von Willebrand disease impacts countless others in our State; and
WHEREAS, without treatment, people with hemophilia and other related bleeding
disorders face frequent, spontaneous bleeding episodes in their joints, causing swelling in the
joints, muscles, internal organs, and brain; repeated bleeding episodes in the joints result in
chronic degenerative arthritic conditions, which often lead to frequent hospitalizations,
permanent disability, and chronic pain; bleeding episodes involving internal organs and the
brain can cause permanent damage, disability, and even death; and
WHEREAS, many individuals with hemophilia became infected with HIV and Hepatitis C
in the 1980s due to the contamination of the blood supply and blood products; and
WHEREAS, with proper care and access to comprehensive medical resources, persons
with hemophilia and other related bleeding disorders can control bleeding episodes and lead
productive lives; and
WHEREAS, visits to federally recognized hemophilia treatment centers reduce morbidity
and mortality significantly; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee is committed to proper care and treatment of children and adults
with hemophilia and other related bleeding disorders; and
WHEREAS, this Awareness Month will generate greater understanding of not only
hemophilia but all inheritable bleeding disorders; and

WHEREAS, this Awareness Month will foster a greater sense of community and shared
purpose among individuals with inheritable bleeding disorders; and
WHEREAS, this Awareness Month will elevate the awareness of and engagement in the
inheritable bleeding disorders journey beyond this community to the general public, enabling the
prevention of illness, unnecessary procedures, and disability; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we proudly commemorate March 2025 as "Bleeding Disorders Awareness
Month" in the State of Tennessee.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared

the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
