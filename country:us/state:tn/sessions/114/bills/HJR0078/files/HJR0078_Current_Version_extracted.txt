HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 78
By Vital
A RESOLUTION to celebrate the month of April 2025 as
"Tennessee Native Plant Month."
WHEREAS, native plants are indigenous species that have evolved alongside native
wildlife and occur naturally in a particular geographic region, ecosystem, and habitat; and
WHEREAS, native plants are essential for healthy, diverse, and sustainable ecosystems
and are critical for cleaning air, filtering water, and stabilizing soils; and
WHEREAS, native plants are well-adapted to Tennessee's soils, temperatures,
precipitation, and environmental conditions, making them the best option for conserving and
protecting our environment and adapting to its changes; and
WHEREAS, native plants provide food, including nectar, pollen, seeds, and foliage for
native birds, caterpillars, butterflies, bees, and other wildlife in ways that non-native plants
cannot; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee is home to more than 2,400 native plant species, which include
large shade trees, shrubs, perennials, vines, grasses, and wildflowers; and
WHEREAS, some of Tennessee's rarest plants are federally listed under the
Endangered Species Act of 1973 and include Pyne's ground plum (Astragalus bibullatus),
Ruth's golden aster (Pityopsis ruthii), and Spring Creek bladderpod (Paysonia perforata), which
are only found in Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, it is important to raise public awareness about the benefits of Tennessee's
native plants to pollinators and other wildlife, to the economy, and to the health and
sustainability of Tennessee's ecosystem; now, therefore,
