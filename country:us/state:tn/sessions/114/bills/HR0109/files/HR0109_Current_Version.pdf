HOUSE RESOLUTION 109
By Miller
A RESOLUTION to honor the Intern basketball team for defeating
the Member team for the second straight year.
WHEREAS, events such as March Madness, The Masters, and the Super Bowl
transcend the normal scope of athletic competition to become cultural icons, and the Interns
versus Members basketball game is certainly one such event; and
WHEREAS, this legislative version of March Madness has been played for many years
and has gained worldwide recognition as a captivating sporting competition; and
WHEREAS, on March 25, 2025, history was made once again as the sprightly Interns
faced the decrepit Members to hoop it up at Allen Arena on the campus of Lipscomb University;
and
WHEREAS, the Intern ballers crushed the Member benchers by a score of 69-42 to win
the heated rivalry game in style and humble their legislative bosses for the second year in a
row; and
WHEREAS, the world champion Intern team featured an outstanding array of roundball
talent, including Malik Abdullah, an intern for Representative Parkinson and a student at
Tennessee State University; Nehemiah DeMar, an intern for Representative Love and a student
at Tennessee State University; Joseph DiMaggio, an intern for Lieutenant Governor McNally
and a student at Belmont University; Maverick Emberton, an intern for Chairman Terry and a

University; Darryan Walker, an intern for Senator Hatcher and a student at Tennessee State
University; Omar Watkins, an intern for Chairlady Dawn White and a student at Tennessee

student at Belmont University, who scored 24 points and was named the game's Most Valuable
Player; and
WHEREAS, Jadyn Cochrane, an intern for Representative Miller and a student at
Tennessee State University, provided expert leadership as the Intern team's Head Coach, while
Piper Harris, an intern for Chairman Bulso and a student at Freed-Hardeman University, urged
the Interns on to victory as their Spirit Coach; and
WHEREAS, Shirley Frierson, Director of the Tennessee Legislative Internship Program
(TLIP), and J.R. Russell, Administrator of TLIP, watched in awe as their young charges
dismantled the ancient Members piece by piece; and
WHEREAS, the 2025 Interns versus Members basketball game added another chapter
to the ongoing saga of this fierce rivalry, one that is equivalent to the feud between the Hatfields
and McCoys, and we find it appropriate to record for posterity the gruesome details of the
Interns' rout of the Members; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor the
coaches and members of the Intern basketball team for defeating the Member team for the
second straight year, recognize the incredible talent of the Intern hoopsters, and wish them all
the best in their future endeavors.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.
