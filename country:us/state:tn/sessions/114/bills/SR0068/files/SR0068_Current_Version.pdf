SENATE RESOLUTION 68
By Massey
A RESOLUTION to commemorate Women Veterans Appreciation
Day, June 12, 2025.
WHEREAS, throughout all periods of history for both the State of Tennessee and the
United States, women have served proudly as citizens and as public servants, unofficially and
formally, in their efforts to secure and preserve the freedom of all; and
WHEREAS, women have proudly served informally since the inception of the United
States military and most honorably for the State of Tennessee, with notable dates being the
Army Nurses Corps, 1901; Women Armed Services Integration Act, June 12, 1948; and combat
jobs opened to women, December 3, 2015; and
WHEREAS, women have also served honorably and with valor from the times of the
American Revolution to today, as the United States still participates in current worldwide
conflicts; women serve in the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Space Force, Coast Guard,
Reserves, and National Guard; and
WHEREAS, a significant number of women have served this country, rising to more than
350,000 women during World War II, when they served in all functional areas of war, as some
female troops were captured and held as Prisoners of War, while others made the ultimate
sacrifice; and
WHEREAS, women continued through the mid-1990s to fight for the right to serve their
country, and the State of Tennessee recognizes and respects the contributions that they have
made through centuries of faithful service; and
WHEREAS, the State of Tennessee has over 40,000 women veterans who have served
this country and State with courageous, honorable military service and continue to serve their
communities, schools, businesses, and religious institutions; and
