SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 305
By Yarbro
A RESOLUTION to honor the enduring legacy of Juno Frankie
Pierce of Nashville.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those historic citizens who, through their
extraordinary efforts, distinguished themselves as intrepid leaders whose contributions have
echoed through ages; and
WHEREAS, one such individual was Juno Frankie Pierce, founder of the Tennessee
Vocational School for Colored Girls, who most assuredly changed the course of countless lives
and improved the well-being of generations; and
WHEREAS, born in 1864 to Nellie Seay, who was enslaved by a Smith County
lawmaker, Frankie Pierce attended the McKee School, a private school for African Americans in
Nashville formed as a mission of the Presbyterian Church; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Pierce lived to be ninety years old and is buried in the Greenwood
Cemetery in Nashville; and
WHEREAS, during her remarkable lifetime, Frankie Pierce served as president of the
Negro Women's Reconstruction League and was the founder of the Nashville Federation of
Colored Women's Clubs; she used her platform to uplift the voices of Black women in Nashville
and the State of Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, in May 1920, she was invited to the state suffragette convention held in the
House chamber of the Tennessee Capitol; while there, she is noted as having stated, "We want
recognition in all forms of this government. We want a state vocational school and a child
welfare department of the state, and more room in state schools"; and

like-minded young women who are dedicated to civic participation, campus involvement, and,

established during her nine decades of life and her lifetime of devoted advocacy and community
service; and
