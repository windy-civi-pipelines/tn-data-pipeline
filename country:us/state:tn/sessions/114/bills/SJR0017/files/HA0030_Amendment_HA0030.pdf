of nuclear-powered submarines; and

for racial discrimination is over," and during his time as governor, he ensured that African
Americans were appointed to public offices; and

from fellow Democrats, he made political history by going from "Jimmy Who?" to winning the

1977 to 1981; and

campaign to conserve energy and, as a part of that, signed the Department of Energy
Organization Act on August 4, 1977; and
WHEREAS, his legacy also includes brokering peace between Israel and Egypt, inviting
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David in
September 1978; the meeting resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war
between the two countries and garnered Egypt's formal recognition of Israel as an independent
state; and
WHEREAS, on January 19, 1981, following a terrorist attack on the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran, Iran, in which 53 Americans were taken hostage and held for 444 days; President
Carter secured the safe release of the hostages through his tireless efforts and the execution of
the Algiers Accords; and
WHEREAS, President Carter was universally recognized by Republicans and
Democrats alike as a statesman who, as his successor President Reagan stated in his October
1, 1986, address at the dedication of the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, Georgia,
modeled the fundamental values of hard work, perseverance, loyalty, and family that made our
nation flourish and grow great; and
