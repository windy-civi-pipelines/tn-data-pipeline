SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 17
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of United States President
Jimmy Carter.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly were greatly saddened to learn of
the passing of United States President Jimmy Carter; and
WHEREAS, President Carter was a man of deep faith, a humanitarian of the highest
order, and a true exemplar of servant-hearted leadership as a way of life; and
WHEREAS, James Earl Carter, Jr., was born on October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, the
eldest child of James Earl Carter, Sr., and Bessie Lillian Gordy Carter, who together started a
peanut business; and
WHEREAS, after high school, Jimmy Carter was a submarine officer with the United
States Navy, serving seven years before returning to run the family farm upon the death of his
father; he was thus a peanut farmer when he entered politics on the ground floor, achieving
election to local school and library boards before becoming a member of the Georgia State
Senate; and
WHEREAS, he served two terms as a state senator before being elected as Georgia's
76th Governor, a post he held from 1971 to 1975; in his inaugural speech, at a time when
desegregation and civil rights remained tinderbox issues, Jimmy Carter declared that "the time
for racial discrimination is over," and during his time as governor, he ensured that African
Americans were appointed to public offices; and
WHEREAS, although his bid for the presidency initially polled at four-percent support
from fellow Democrats, he toppled incumbent Gerald Ford to become the 39th President of the
United States, serving in the country's highest office from 1977 to 1981; and

WHEREAS, his presidency was marked by his support of women, including his
appointment of women to key positions within his administration and encouragement of his wife,
Rosalynn Carter, to maintain a national profile as First Lady; he also championed an equal
rights amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would have provided legal protection against
discrimination on the grounds of sex; and
WHEREAS, President Carter was one of the first international leaders to take climate
change seriously; he installed solar panels on the roof of the White House and passed laws to
protect millions of acres of unspoiled land in Alaska from development; and
WHEREAS, early in his term, President Jimmy Carter collaborated with Congress to
fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet-level education department, and on October 17,
1979, he signed into law the Department of Education Organization Act, establishing the United
States Department of Education; he also expanded the Head Start program to include an
additional 43,000 children and families; and
WHEREAS, under President Carter's administration, the United States Foreign Service
lifted its ban on gay and lesbian personnel, and in 1977, the Carter administration became the
first U.S. presidential administration to invite gay and lesbian rights activists to the White House
to discuss federal policy on ending discrimination in the federal government on the basis of
sexual orientation; and
WHEREAS, his legacy also includes brokering peace between Israel and Egypt, inviting
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to Camp David in
September 1978; the meeting resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war
between the two countries and garnered Egypt's formal recognition of Israel as an independent
state; and
WHEREAS, in his post-presidency years, Jimmy Carter established the Carter Center to
promote and expand human rights, leading to his receipt of a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002; he

also became a key figure in Habitat for Humanity, volunteering with the nonprofit alongside his
wife beginning in 1984. He ultimately helped build 4,447 homes for those in need; and
WHEREAS, President Carter was deeply devoted to his family, and he always
endeavored to remain true to family values of the highest order; and
WHEREAS, he enjoyed the loving companionship of his beloved wife of seventy-seven
years, Rosalynn Smith Carter, who preceded him in death in 2023; together they were blessed
with four children, Jack, James "Chip" III, Donnel, and Amy; twelve grandchildren; and thirteen
great-grandchildren; and
WHEREAS, President Jimmy Carter leaves behind an indelible legacy of integrity and
probity in public life, compassion and loyalty in private life, and diligence and dedication in all his
chosen endeavors; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should remember the bountiful life of this exceptional
public servant and human being; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of United States President
Jimmy Carter, reflecting fondly upon his impeccable character and his legacy of compassionate
service.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
