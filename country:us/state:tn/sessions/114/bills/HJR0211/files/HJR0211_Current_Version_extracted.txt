Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 211
By Powell
A RESOLUTION to honor the Valor College Prep Wildcats girls'
volleyball team on winning the 2024 TSSAA
Class AA state championship.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those successful athletic teams that,
through their magnificent exploits, bring honor to Tennessee and serve as exceptional
ambassadors for this State; and
WHEREAS, one such estimable group of young women is the Valor College Prep girls'
volleyball team; the Wildcats recently won the 2024 TSSAA Class AA state championship, thus
claiming their school's first state title in any girls' sport and the first state title in any girls' sport by
a public charter school; and
WHEREAS, this is an achievement of monumental proportions and significance, and
they are deserving of our highest regard; and
WHEREAS, after falling just short of winning the state championship in 2023, the
Wildcats garnered their experience, maturity, and confidence as they embarked upon a revenge
mission in 2024, posting 13 consecutive victories at the end of the season to claim the state
title; the squad also posted 22 consecutive home victories and 25 consecutive district wins and,
most impressively, posted a perfect record in the Class AA classification for the entire season;
and
WHEREAS, in the Class AA state tournament, Valor College Prep dominated the
competition, never trailing by a set across the four-day event; the Wildcats swept Crockett
County in the opening round and then proceeded to defeat Creek Wood 3-1; and

WHEREAS, Valor College Prep next swept Dyer County to secure a berth in the
championship match and then completed its title run by besting the Lady Choctaws in four sets
to bring home the gold with an incredible 30-4 final record; and
WHEREAS, the Wildcats were led to the promised land by the Class AA state
tournament's Most Valuable Player, sophomore middle blocker Kerrington Corbin, who finished
the championship game with 18 total points, 16 kills, 1 dig, and 4 blocks; and
WHEREAS, brilliant performances were also turned in by two-time All-State selection,
sophomore outside hitter, Anarela Mejias Ayala, who was voted the Nashville area's top
volleyball player in a preseason poll, and All-Mid State honorees, junior libero, Marley Maestas
and freshman outside hitter, Jentelle McNairl; and
WHEREAS, other key contributors to the Wildcats' success include freshman, Bella
Brooks; sophomores, Annie Shive, Elsa Love, Neena Valdez, Lily Quick, and Sydney Corby;
junior, Sydney Garrett; and seniors, Miah Ruiz, Amy Sandoval, and Sarah Escalona; and
WHEREAS, the Wildcats were fortunate to have the leadership and expertise of Kylie
Harvey, the all-time winningest coach in Valor College Prep history, who was named Coach of
the Year at the state level; and
WHEREAS, the Wildcats epitomize all that is good in today's student athletes, as they
have achieved a premier level of success in competition while exhibiting the highest degree of
character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, their perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent not only made
possible a championship season but also surely bode well for each player's future success; and
WHEREAS, we find it appropriate to acknowledge and applaud the Valor College Prep
Wildcats girls' volleyball team, not only for winning the state championship but also for the
players' superior sportsmanship and the joy they have brought to their fellow students and fans;
now, therefore,
- 2 - 003367
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and congratulate the Valor College Prep Wildcats girls' volleyball
team upon winning the 2024 TSSAA Class AA state championship. We salute these
exceptional young women for their many accomplishments, both on and off the court, and
extend to them our best wishes for much continued success.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
