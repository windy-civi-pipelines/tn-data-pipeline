SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 201
By McNally
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Margaret Jewel "Margie"
Ison of Knoxville.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly were greatly saddened to learn of
the passing of Knoxville broadcast legend Margaret Jewel "Margie" Ison; and
WHEREAS, for more than three decades, thousands of East Tennesseans welcomed
Margie Ison into their homes, most notably as the longtime meteorologist with WBIR in
Knoxville; more than simply a trusted source of weather information, she became a treasured
presence who felt like a friend to so many; and
WHEREAS, born in Brotherton on July 7, 1940, Mrs. Ison was the daughter of Reverend
Samuel Ernest "S.E." Wood and Daisy Jewel Jernigan Wood and attended Central Cookeville
High School, where she was voted by her peers as "Most Talented" and produced her own
radio show with WHUB in Cookeville; and
WHEREAS, it was also during high school that she met the love of her life, Jim Ison,
while singing with the high school orchestra at a church event; the two were married in
Ringgold, Georgia, on December 28, 1957; and
WHEREAS, Margie Ison's television career began in Chattanooga in the 1960s, when
she sang on the Roy Morris Variety Show on WRCB and worked as the entertainment support
during a special program celebrating Chattanooga's 150th anniversary; and
WHEREAS, she came on board at Knoxville's WBIR-TV Channel 10 in 1969 as a
"weather girl," having no previous experience or credentials as a meteorologist at the time; a
popular addition to the newscast, she blazed a trail as the station's first weather forecaster and
would inspire many others to take up the mantle after her; and

WHEREAS, after her initial stint with WBIR, she left to work at WATE-TV Channel 6 from
1971 to 1979, during which time she reported the weather at 6:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. and
hosted a daily talk show; she returned to WBIR in 1979, bringing thousands of viewers with her,
which pushed WBIR to the top of local broadcast ratings; and
WHEREAS, during her tenure as a Knoxville meteorologist, her infectious personality
cemented her as a local legend, with many parroting her catchphrase, "Margie said it would," a
nod to the trust she had earned among her viewers who knew they could count on her
forecasts; and
WHEREAS, Margie Ison's distinguished tenure also included entertainment reporting
with "Margie on Location" segments that covered music and art from the local Knoxville area,
throughout the East Tennessee region, and beyond, including Dollywood, the Grand Ole Opry,
Opryland, the CMA Awards, Fan Fair, and the annual Cowboy Gold International Bluegrass
Music Festival in Kumamoto, Japan, in 1990; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Ison created the Area Weather Spotter Network, which is still in effect
today, and utilized the Ham Radio Operators and the National Weather Service to gather
accurate weather information and forecasts; and
WHEREAS, although she retired from WBIR in 1995, she filled in temporarily as a guest
weather personality on WATE from 1996 to 2001; she was also in the Knoxville and East
Tennessee area as a keynote speaker and as vocal entertainment for various organizations;
and
WHEREAS, devoted to serving her community, Mrs. Ison served on the Board of
Directors for Goodwill Industries of Knoxville for more than twenty years and also served on the
advisory board of the Caswell Boys and Girls Club and the Interfaith Health Clinic board, and
she participated in fundraising telethons for the East Tennessee Children's Hospital March of
Dimes, the Jerry Lewis M & A telethon, and PBS Channel 2 telethon; and
