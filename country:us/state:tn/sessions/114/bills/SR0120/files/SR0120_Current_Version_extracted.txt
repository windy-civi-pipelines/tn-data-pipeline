general, district public defenders, and court

complaints about judges and issue appropriate sanctions, there are no corresponding codes of

begin the process of drafting and adopting codes of conduct in the court rules for district
attorneys general, district public defenders, and court clerks.

three to five individuals involved in the judicial process to evaluate recent alleged misconduct
regarding three elected district attorneys general to determine if any actions need to be taken to
hold those officials accountable and preserve the integrity of the judicial branch.
