Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 7
By Johnson
A RESOLUTION to designate Sunday, February 2, 2025, and the
first Sunday in February thereafter as "Four
Chaplains Day" in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, this General Assembly wishes to commemorate an extraordinary act of
heroism and sacrifice by noncombatants during World War II that endures as an exemplar of
faith, courage, and selflessness in the face of tragedy; and
WHEREAS, on February 3, 1943, the U.S. Army transport ship Dorchester was
torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of Newfoundland; the ship sank in less than twenty
minutes and only 230 of the 902 men aboard survived; and
WHEREAS, the nation was shocked by the magnitude of this wartime tragedy but
inspired by the heroism of the four U.S. Army chaplains who served on the Dorchester; and
WHEREAS, graduates of the U.S. Army Chaplain School at Harvard, these four brave
men were Lt. George L. Fox, a minister of the Methodist Church; Lt. Alexander D. Goode, a
rabbi of the Jewish faith; Lt. John P. Washington, a Roman Catholic priest; and Lt. Clark V.
Poling, a pastor with the Dutch Reformed Church; and
WHEREAS, when the Dorchester was torpedoed, the vessel began to sink rapidly, and
the captain ordered his crew to abandon ship; and
WHEREAS, as pandemonium ensued onboard, The Four Chaplains spread out among
the soldiers, calming the frightened, tending to the wounded, guiding the disoriented toward
safety, offering prayers for the dying, and encouraging those who would live; and
WHEREAS, when the majority of the crew had reached the deck, the chaplains began
distributing lifejackets to the men; the supply was soon depleted, and the chaplains removed

their own lifejackets and gave them to four frightened young soldiers, thus sacrificing their own
lives to save the lives of others; and
WHEREAS, as the Dorchester went down, The Four Chaplains linked arms, braced
themselves against the deck, and prayed to God for the souls of their shipmates; and
WHEREAS, Lt. Fox, Lt. Goode, Lt. Poling, and Lt. Washington were posthumously
awarded the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Purple Heart for their heroic actions on
that fateful day; and
WHEREAS, in 1960, the U.S. Congress authorized The Four Chaplains Medal for Fox,
Goode, Poling, and Washington; and
WHEREAS, more than eighty years later, the State of Tennessee seeks to memorialize
The Four Chaplains for their courage and selflessness aboard the Dorchester on February 3,
1943; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that Sunday, February 2, 2025, and the first Sunday in
February thereafter are designated as "Four Chaplains Day" in Tennessee to honor the memory
of Lt. George L. Fox, a minister of the Methodist Church; Lt. Alexander D. Goode, a rabbi of the
Jewish faith; Lt. John P. Washington, a Roman Catholic priest; and Lt. Clark V. Poling, a pastor
with the Dutch Reformed Church, as they continue to inspire us through their spirituality and
altruism during World War II.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
