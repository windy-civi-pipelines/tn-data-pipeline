68-218-104. Liability of responsible parties.
(a)
(1) A responsible party is strictly liable for a share of the costs of climate
change adaptation projects and all qualifying expenditures supported by the fund.
(2) For purposes of this section, entities in a controlled group:
(A) Shall be treated by the department as a single entity for the
purposes of identifying responsible parties; and
(B) Are jointly and severally liable for payment of any cost
recovery demand owed by any entity in the controlled group.
(b) With respect to each responsible party, the cost recovery demand must be
equal to an amount that bears the same ratio to the cost to the state and its residents, as
calculated by the state treasurer pursuant to § 68-218-108, from the emission of covered
greenhouse gases during the covered period as the responsible party's applicable share
of covered greenhouse gas emissions bears to the aggregate applicable shares of
covered greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels extracted or
refined during the covered period.
(c) If a responsible party owns a minority interest of ten percent (10%) or more in
another entity, the responsible party's applicable share of covered greenhouse gas
emissions must be increased by the applicable share of covered greenhouse gas
emissions for the entity in which the responsible party holds a minority interest multiplied
by the percentage of the minority interest held by the responsible party.
(d) The department shall use the United States environmental protection
agency's Emissions Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories as applied to the fossil fuel
- 7 - 001954

volume data for the purpose of determining the amount of covered greenhouse gas
emissions attributable to any entity from the fossil fuels attributable to the entity.
(e) The department may adjust the cost recovery demand amount of a
responsible party who refined petroleum products or who is a successor in interest to an
entity that refines petroleum products if the responsible party establishes to the
satisfaction of the department that:
(1) A portion of the cost recovery demand amount was attributable to the
refining of crude oil extracted by another responsible party; and
(2) The crude oil extracted by the other responsible party was accounted
for when the department determined the cost recovery demand amount for the
other entity or a successor in interest of the other entity.
(f) The department shall issue the cost recovery demands required under this
section not later than six (6) months following the adoption of the rules required under §
68-218-106(b)(2).
(g)
(1) Except as provided in subdivision (g)(2), a responsible party shall pay
the cost recovery demand amount in full not later than six (6) months following
the department's issuance of the cost recovery demand.
(2)
(A) A responsible party may elect to pay the cost recovery
demand amount in nine (9) annual installments in accordance with this
subdivision (g)(2).
(B) The first installment must be paid not later than six (6) months
following the department's issuance of the cost recovery demand and
- 8 - 001954

must be equal to twenty percent (20%) of the total cost recovery demand
amount.
(C) Each subsequent installment must be paid one (1) year from
the initial payment each subsequent year and be equal to ten percent
(10%) of the total cost recovery demand amount. The department may
charge reasonable interest on each installment payment or a payment
delayed for any other reason and, at the commissioner of environment
and conservation's discretion, may adjust the amount of a subsequent
installment payment or a payment delayed for any other reason to reflect
increases or decreases in the consumer price index.
(D)
(i) The unpaid balance of all remaining installments
become due immediately if:
(a) The responsible party fails to pay any
installment in a timely manner, as specified in department
rules;
(b) Except as provided in subdivision (g)(2)(D)(ii),
there is a liquidation or sale of substantially all the assets
of the responsible party; or
(c) The responsible party ceases to do business.
(ii) In the case of a sale of substantially all the assets of a
responsible party, the remaining installments do not become due
immediately if the buyer enters into an agreement with the
department under which the buyer assumes liability for the
- 9 - 001954

remaining installments due under this subdivision (g)(2) in the
same manner as if the buyer were the responsible party.
(h) The department shall deposit cost recovery payments collected under this
chapter to the climate resiliency fund established under § 68-215-105.
(i) A responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a notice of cost recovery
demand must exhaust administrative remedies by filing a request for reconsideration
with the department within thirty (30) days following issuance of the notice of cost
recovery demand. A request for reconsideration must state the grounds for the request
and include supporting documentation. The department shall notify the responsible
party of the final decision by issuing a subsequent notice of cost recovery demand. A
responsible party aggrieved by the issuance of a final notice of cost recovery demand
may bring an action in Davidson County chancery court.
(j) This section does not supersede or diminish in any way any other remedies
available to a person at common law or under statute.
