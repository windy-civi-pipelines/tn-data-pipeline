SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 52
By Lamar
A RESOLUTION to reaffirm the General Assembly's intent to
protect pregnant people and their friends and
family.
WHEREAS, no one should fear arrest, prosecution, or civil penalties for experiencing or
helping a loved one with a pregnancy loss; and
WHEREAS, pregnancy can result in a variety of outcomes, including live birth,
miscarriage, stillbirth, and abortion; and
WHEREAS, the abortion laws of the State of Tennessee protect pregnant people from
prosecution; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee has the third-highest number of cases in which a pregnant
person is charged with a crime relating to their pregnancy outcomes in the United States; and
WHEREAS, the American Bar Association and the American Medical Association
oppose the criminalization of pregnant people for their pregnancy outcomes, including
miscarriage, stillbirth, abortion, or other pregnancy outcome; and
WHEREAS, in 2016, the members of the legislature decided soundly that prosecuting
pregnant people for drug use goes against public health and medical standards, allowing the so-
called fetal assault law to sunset and guaranteeing protection from prosecution in the criminal
statutes; and
WHEREAS, family and friends are key social support networks for pregnant and
parenting Tennesseans, helping pregnant and parenting Tennesseans with a variety of
emotional and physical supports; and
WHEREAS, pregnancy loss should not be made more complicated or difficult by criminal
or civil penalties for those experiencing the loss and their loved ones; and

WHEREAS, laws that result in the criminalization of people experiencing pregnancy loss
and their loved ones force them to make impossible decisions about whether to break the law
and face criminal penalties or abandon their loved ones in a time of need; and
WHEREAS, laws that criminalize pregnancy outcomes disproportionately impact low-
income Tennesseans and Tennesseans of color; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that it is our intention that the laws of this State not be
used to criminalize pregnant people and their loved ones for their pregnancy outcomes.
