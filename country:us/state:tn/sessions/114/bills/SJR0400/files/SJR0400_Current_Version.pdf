SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 400
By Yarbro
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Gladys Maurine
Chatman.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly were greatly saddened to learn of
the passing of Gladys Maurine Chatman; and
WHEREAS, born on March 12, 1928, in Gleason to Edgar Lee and Ida McGehee,
Gladys Chatman enjoyed a bucolic existence in Weakley County on a sweet potato farm with
her five siblings, and although they did not have electricity until Mrs. Chatman was thirteen, their
riches in familial love and agrarian simplicity were apparent and abundant; and
WHEREAS, due to her parents' strenuous efforts and educational emphasis, all six of
their children, including Mrs. Chatman, were able to attend college and earn degrees; Mrs.
Chatman graduated as the valedictorian of Gleason High School and went on to graduate from
Bethel College and Middle Tennessee State University, where she met her beloved husband,
Walter Chatman; and
WHEREAS, once the couple moved to Nashville, Mrs. Chatman became a school social
worker, a job that suited her frank yet friendly demeanor, and in her decades-long tenure, she
assisted countless middle and high school students in realizing their true potential and actuating
their best self; and
WHEREAS, Mrs. Chatman, ever athirst for knowledge, decided after her retirement to
take Lifelong Learner courses through Vanderbilt University, and she always remained abreast
of current events and active in politics; and
WHEREAS, not wishing to hide her lamp under a bushel, she began to give generously
of her time as a volunteer for St. Thomas Hospital and Meals on Wheels, in addition to her work
with Women's Club programs; and
