HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 321
By Reeves
A RESOLUTION to recognize and commend Davis House Child
Advocacy Center on its twenty-fifth anniversary.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly take great pleasure in recognizing
those estimable organizations that are devoted to improving the lives of young people in this
State; and
WHEREAS, one such organization is the Davis House Child Advocacy Center in
Franklin, which celebrates its twenty-fifth anniversary this year; and
WHEREAS, the organization was created in the spring of 1999 by Ronald L. Davis, a
longtime district attorney general in Williamson County's 21st Judicial District, and founded as
the Williamson County Child Advocacy Center Task Force; and
WHEREAS, the initiative was founded out of Mr. Davis's exasperation and great concern
for vulnerable children who, at that time, even if they had the courage to report sexual or severe
physical abuse, faced the compounding trauma of multiple interviews by many adults in scary,
confusing places; typically, children would have to tell the story of their trauma an average of
thirteen times; and
WHEREAS, after a year and a half of planning, the Williamson County Child Advocacy
Center opened its doors in September of 2000; nine years later, after the passing of beloved
founder Ron Davis, the center was renamed Davis House, honoring the namesake's hard work,
vision, and dedication to children; and
WHEREAS, Davis House was designed to provide a safe, child-friendly place for
children to come following allegations of abuse and where they, and their non-offending
caregivers, could receive specific services such as forensic interviews, court advocacy, and
specialized trauma therapy to help them heal from the abuse experienced; and

WHEREAS, Davis House has completed over 10,000 forensic interviews and 5,000
counseling sessions; last year alone, the center served more than 300 children, not including
those whom they continued to support throughout the life of court cases and journeys toward
healing; and
WHEREAS, abuse happens in every community, regardless of socioeconomic status,
race, religion, education, or ethnicity; it happens in homes, neighborhoods, schools, churches,
daycares, and youth sports environments. Recent studies show that one in ten children are
sexually abused before their eighteenth birthday and that in ninety percent of those cases, the
child knows their abuser; and
WHEREAS, through education and prevention programs, Davis House raises
awareness about child abuse, signs to watch for, and preventive measures; this education helps
adults in the community—including parents, teachers, and caregivers—identify potential abuse
early, enabling intervention before harm escalates; and
WHEREAS, the center teaches children in the community age-appropriate lessons on
topics such as safe adults, healthy boundaries, unsafe touches, internet safety, and healthy
relationships, fostering a more vigilant and informed community that can better protect children;
and
WHEREAS, Davis House also works closely with law enforcement, the Department of
Children's Services, the district attorney's office, and other agencies involved in the Child
Protective Investigative Team to create a collaborative approach to reviewing cases of child
abuse, ensuring that every case receives comprehensive attention and that children are
protected in a coordinated and effective way; and
WHEREAS, through its many programs, Davis House fills critical gaps in support,
education, and recovery services for abuse survivors and their families, ultimately working to
create a safer, more aware, and resilient community; and
- 2 - 004620

WHEREAS, Davis House has been wholly devoted to helping children when they are at
their most vulnerable and strengthening their community, bringing justice, treatment, and
prevention to children and families in Williamson County; and
WHEREAS, it is most fitting that we recognize one of this State's most exemplary
advocacy organizations at this time; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we recognize and commend the Davis House Child Advocacy Center in
Franklin for its compassionate service to the children of Williamson County, extending our
deepest gratitude for the center's important work and our best wishes for its continued success.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
