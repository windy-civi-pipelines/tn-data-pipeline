A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Ernest Hamilton "Buddy"
Parks of Chattanooga.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly were greatly saddened to learn of
the passing of Ernest Hamilton "Buddy" Parks of Chattanooga; and
WHEREAS, Ernest Hamilton Parks was an exemplary gentleman and consummate
professional who worked assiduously to improve the quality of life for his fellow citizens in
numerous capacities; and

as a second lieutenant in the United States Army; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Parks, having married his beloved wife, Mackie Sue Roberts, and
desiring to serve his country, moved to Oklahoma to act as an instructor at Fort Sill; and
WHEREAS, he went on to work at Combustion Engineering, and after his retirement in
the 1980s, he began to manage some of the properties of former U.S. Senator Bob Corker,
including such distinguished Chattanoogan structures as the James Building and the Volunteer
Building; and
WHEREAS, the rejuvenating influence of Mr. Parks's management also extended to the
famous Dome Building and nearby Customs House, both of which have merited recognition on
the National Register of Historic Places; and

but also busied himself with caring for the souls at Hixson Church of Christ; and

WHEREAS, raised a Baptist, Mr. Parks became a member of the Churches of Christ a
year after his marriage, and he went on to serve at both East Ridge Church of Christ, where he
was a deacon, and Hixson Church of Christ, where he was an elder for twenty-five years; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Parks deftly applied his skill base from building management to help
redesign one of the church's buildings into a gym and multipurpose area while also constructing
a new worship space; and
WHEREAS, even in the midst of little help and heavy burdens, Mr. Parks and his fellow
elder Pat Roark dedicated themselves to visiting and comforting some 350 congregants,
meeting and discussing weekly about how best to serve their community; and
WHEREAS, passionately appreciative of boats, Mr. Parks and his wife enjoyed nautical
outings in their spare time, and when his wife's health prevented their further boating, Mr. Parks
once again exhibited his characteristic versatility and creativity by fashioning over twenty
wooden model boats, most being replicas of historic watercraft; and
WHEREAS, the Morning Pointe Senior Living home, where Mr. and Mrs. Parks spent
their last years together, allowed Mr. Parks to convert a storage space adjacent to his apartment
into a workshop for his model making, and after constructing so many as to need extra space,
the property company agreed to allow Mr. Parks, who had worked with the company for fifteen
years, to put up shelves and glass cases to display his handiwork; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Parks was also deeply devoted to his family, and he always endeavored
to remain true to family values of the highest order; and
WHEREAS, a loving father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, he is survived by his
son, Ted Parks; daughter, Susan (Philip) Tuckniss; grandchildren, Andrew (Heather) Rogers,
Aden St. Charles, Benjamin (Emily) Parks, and Jacob Parks; and five great-grandchildren,
Jackson Rogers, Ella Rogers, Hadley Rogers, Pax St. Charles, and Mabry St. Charles; and
WHEREAS, he was preceded in death by his wife, Mackie Sue Roberts Parks; and
