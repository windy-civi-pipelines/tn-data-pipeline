HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 355
By Lynn
A RESOLUTION to commemorate "Victims of Communism Day"
in the State of Tennessee.
WHEREAS, over 100 years have passed since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and
the formation of the first communist government under Vladimir Lenin, leading to decades of
oppression and violence under communist regimes throughout the world; and
WHEREAS, based on the economic philosophies of Karl Marx, communism has proven
incompatible with the ideals of liberty, prosperity, and dignity of human life and has given rise to
such infamous totalitarian dictators as Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Pol Pot;
and
WHEREAS, communist regimes worldwide have killed more than 100 million people and
subjected countless others to exploitation and unspeakable atrocities, with victims representing
many different ethnicities, creeds, and backgrounds; and
WHEREAS, through false promises of equality and liberation or through coercion,
brutality, and fear, communist regimes have systematically robbed their own citizens of the
rights of freedom of worship, freedom of speech, and freedom of association; and
WHEREAS, many victims of communism were persecuted as political prisoners for
speaking out against these regimes, and others were killed in genocidal state-sponsored purges
of undesirable groups; and
WHEREAS, in addition to violating basic human rights, communist regimes have
suppressed intellectual freedom, cultural life, and self-determination movements in more than
forty nations; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
HJR0355

CONCURRING, that we join with the people of the State of Tennessee as they observe "Victims

for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
