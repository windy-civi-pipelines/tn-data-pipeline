Section 1:
By Bowling
HOUSE BILL 444
By Hulsey
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 13,
Chapter 20; Title 13, Chapter 21 and Title 29,
Chapter 17, relative to housing authorities.
WHEREAS, the General Assembly expressed the need to protect private property from
eminent domain in Public Chapter 863 in 2006 with the following statement: "It is the intent of
the general assembly that the power of eminent domain shall be used sparingly, and that laws
permitting the use of eminent domain shall be narrowly construed so as not to enlarge by
inference or inadvertently the power of eminent domain."; and
WHEREAS, under Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 13-20-201, the broad definition
of "blighted areas" places non-blighted real property at risk of acquisition by eminent domain
because "blighted areas" may contain individual properties that do not meet the definition of
"blighted areas" under such statute; and
WHEREAS, this act deletes the "blighted areas" definition in Tennessee Code
Annotated, Section 13-20-201, and replaces it with a property-by-property definition to protect
well-kept, code-compliant, non-blighted real properties from being taken by the power of
eminent domain while preserving the ability of housing authorities to use the power of eminent
domain to acquire properties for redevelopment that are truly blighted properties; and
WHEREAS, this act improves due process for property owners by providing a
reasonable amount of time for owners of blighted property to correct code violations that cause
their property to be deemed as blighted before their property is subjected to acquisition by
eminent domain proceedings by housing authorities; and
