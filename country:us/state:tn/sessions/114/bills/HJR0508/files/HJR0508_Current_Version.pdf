HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 508
By Barrett
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend The Elephant Sanctuary
of Tennessee on the occasion of its thirtieth
anniversary.
WHEREAS, located in Hohenwald, The Elephant Sanctuary of Tennessee is the largest
sanctuary in North America providing refuge and care for elephants in need; and
WHEREAS, since 1995, The Elephant Sanctuary of Tennessee has provided refuge for
elephants who have retired from performance and exhibition; now encompassing more than
3,060 acres and three separate and protected natural habitats, the Sanctuary is home to a
dozen elephant residents, with room for more; and
WHEREAS, the success and continued growth of The Elephant Sanctuary is due in
large part to the dedication and hard work of two individuals who have contributed significantly
to its mission, namely Lois C. Knight and Dr. William Schaffner; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Knight has been a part of The Elephant Sanctuary since its inception,
serving in multiple capacities as a volunteer, liaison, and key contributor to community outreach
and fundraising efforts; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Schaffner has served as an advisor to The Elephant Sanctuary since
1995 and as a board member since 2007, sharing his expertise and leadership in the field of
infectious diseases and health; his advocacy for the best medical care for elephants in human
care and for science-based protection for elephant caretakers has shaped the facility's health
and safety protocols; and
WHEREAS, today, the Sanctuary employs fifty staff in Lewis County, who work to
provide home, herd, rest, refuge, and individualized care for life to the elephants who have
spent years performing in circuses and educating the public in zoos; and

WHEREAS, the Sanctuary is a boon for this rural Tennessee area, providing not only
career and internship opportunities but also volunteer experiences; the Sanctuary's Discovery
Center offers hands-on, self-guided exhibits and educational programming for families, schools,

WHEREAS, at The Sanctuary, elephants have the opportunity to live in expansive and
diverse habitats in the rolling hills of Tennessee, which allow for a range of vegetation for
foraging, enrichment, and natural behaviors; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend The Elephant Sanctuary of Tennessee on the
