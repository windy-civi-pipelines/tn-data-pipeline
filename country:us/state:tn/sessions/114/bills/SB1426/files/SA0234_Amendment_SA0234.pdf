AMEND S e n ate Bill No. 1426 House Bill No. 411*
by deleting all language after the enacting clause and substituting:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 71, Chapter 5, Part 1, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:
(a) As used in this section, "managed care organization" or "MCO" means a
health maintenance organization, behavioral health organization, or managed health
insurance issuer that participates in the TennCare program.
(b) The division of TennCare may require every group health insurance contract,
and every group hospital or medical expense insurance policy, plan, and group policy
delivered, issued for delivery, amended, or renewed in this state by an MCO on or after
January 1, 2026, to provide coverage for physician prescribed treatment, deemed
medically necessary pursuant to ยง 71-5-144, of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric
disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) and pediatric acute-onset
neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). Such treatment may include antibiotics, medication,
behavioral therapies to manage neuropsychiatric symptoms, immunomodulating
medicines, plasma exchange, and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Benefits
provided under this section are not subject to a greater co-payment, deductible, or
coinsurance than another similar benefit provided by the MCO. Coverage authorization
must be provided in a timely manner consistent with department of commerce and
insurance rules for urgent treatments adopted pursuant to the Uniform Administrative
Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5.

(c) A group or individual policy of accident and health insurance or managed
care must not deny or delay coverage for medically necessary treatment under this
section solely because the recipient previously received treatment, including the same or
similar treatment, for PANDAS or PANS, or because the recipient has been diagnosed
with or received treatment for their condition under a different diagnostic name, such as
autoimmune encephalopathy. For the purposes of this section, when medically
necessary pursuant to ยง 71-5-144, coverage of PANDAS and PANS may take into
consideration the treatment recommendations developed by a medical professional
consortium convened for the purposes of researching, identifying, and publishing best
practice standards for diagnosis and treatment of such disorders that are accessible for
medical professionals and are based on evidence of positive patient outcomes. This
section does not prevent an MCO from requesting treatment notes and anticipated
duration of treatment and outcomes.
(d) For billing and diagnosis purposes, PANDAS and PANS must be coded as
autoimmune encephalitis until the American Medical Association and the centers for
medicare and medicaid services create and assign a specific code for PANDAS and
PANS. Thereafter, PANDAS and PANS may be coded as autoimmune encephalitis,
PANDAS, or PANS. If a new common name or code is utilized for PANDAS and PANS,
then this section applies to patients with conditions under that new common name or
code.
SECTION 2. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
