WHEREAS, John Bouchard & Sons Co. was founded in 1900 near Nashville's Capitol
Hill by John Bouchard and his two sons as a machine shop; and
WHEREAS, today, John Bouchard & Sons Co. is a fifth-generation, family owned and
operated business in Nashville that is dedicated to building and sustaining durable infrastructure
throughout the Mid-South; and
WHEREAS, John Bouchard, originally from Quebec, Canada, immigrated during the
Civil War era to Chicago, Illinois, where he rose to serve as chief engineer for P.D. Armour's
meatpacking plant, which, by innovation, processed more than one million animals per year and
became one of the largest in the country, with a facility covering five city blocks; and
WHEREAS, he received three U.S. patents for his inventions, including a hog-scraping
machine, a switch for overhead tracks, and an ammonia refrigerating machine, of which kind
many were installed for the Armour plant and their competitors; and
WHEREAS, he brought this innovative mindset to Tennessee, where his company
designed, installed, and maintained the first refrigeration systems for institutions such as the
Hermitage Hotel, Vanderbilt University Hospital, Tennessee State Penitentiary, Standard
Candy, Capitol Theater, Lookout Mountain Hotel, and ice-manufacturing facilities from Jackson
to Knoxville; and
WHEREAS, the company has grown into a diversified business of nearly 200 employees
and now provides not only machine shop services but also iron construction castings, sales and
servicing of air compressors and other industrial equipment, and construction services in the
mechanical, plumbing, electrical, and fire-sprinkler trades to thousands of commercial,

Companies, which together "represent the State's thriving industries and have provided
countless opportunities to Tennesseans in communities across the State"; and

communities, from raising funds for World War I through the sale of U.S. Liberty Bonds, to

numerous employees who served during World War II, the Korean Conflict, Vietnam, and the
Global War on Terror; and
WHEREAS, the company's legacy of public service ranges from John E. Bouchard, Sr.'s

E. Bouchard Ill's leadership in the late 1970s as the Nashville Rotary Club's president in
establishing the Tennessee Girl's Ranch, to the company's 2010 participation in Extreme Home
Makeover's rebuilding of Lighthouse Christian School after the Nashville flood, and finally to its

REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we recognize John Bouchard & Sons Co. on the
