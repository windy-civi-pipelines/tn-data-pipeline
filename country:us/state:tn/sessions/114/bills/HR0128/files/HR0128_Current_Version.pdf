who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, Malik Williamson, a six-foot, three-inch eighth grader, is a valuable member
of Bartlett's Elmore Park Middle School Eagles boys' basketball team that recently won its third
consecutive TMSAA Class AAA state championship, capping a third consecutive undefeated
season with a perfect 31-0 record; and
WHEREAS, the Eagles' overall record during this three-peat championship run is an
incredible 96-0; the team's record for the last four years is 118-3; and

crushed Page 51-24 and then trounced Richview 53-32 to earn the three-peat and bring home
the gold; and
WHEREAS, Malik Williamson epitomizes all that is good in today's student athletes, as
he has achieved a premier level of success in competition while exhibiting the highest degree of
character in all aspects of life; and
