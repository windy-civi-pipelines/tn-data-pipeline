Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 118
By Hale
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Evan Boyd for his act of
heroism.
WHEREAS, we are honored to recognize those selfless individuals whose quick thinking
and decisive actions have saved the lives of those in peril; and
WHEREAS, Evan Boyd, a fourteen-year-old student from Gordonsville High School,
recently become a hero of the highest order when he bravely stepped in to prevent a dangerous
situation from becoming deadly; and
WHEREAS, on January 30, 2025, Evan noticed something unusual during class; he
looked over and saw another student playing with his waistband, and when he asked the
student what he was doing, he flashed what appeared to be a handgun; and
WHEREAS, alarmed, Evan Boyd walked behind the student and grabbed him, saying,
"Hey, he has a gun"; as chaos quickly ensued with students running for safety, Evan showed
remarkable composure, wrestling the weapon away from his classmate's waistband and tossing
it aside before tackling him to the ground; and
WHEREAS, Evan restrained the student until a teacher arrived to assist; ultimately,
school staff and local law enforcement handled the situation, finding that the student had
brought a BB gun that closely resembled a handgun onto campus; and
WHEREAS, Evan Boyd's modesty regarding his heroic act stands in great contrast to
the immense impact of his actions, which likely prevented a potential tragedy from unfolding in
his classroom; and
WHEREAS, Evan's quick thinking under pressure and compassionate action are a
testament to his character and bravery; and
