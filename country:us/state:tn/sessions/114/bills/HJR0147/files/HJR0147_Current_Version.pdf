HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 147
By Helton-Haynes
A RESOLUTION relative to the regulation of Kratom.
WHEREAS, an estimated 1.7 million Americans aged twelve and older currently use
Mitragynine, or Kratom, to self-treat various medical conditions; and
WHEREAS, Kratom mimics the opioids currently problematic for abuse, addiction, and
lethal side effects, yet the substance can be legally purchased by adults in Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, popularly referred to as "gas station heroin," Kratom is sold in capsule,
powder, and liquid extract form at convenience stores across the State and can often be found
between the gum and drink selections; and
WHEREAS, the myriad formulations of Kratom have various concentrations and doses
and are not accompanied by specific information about ingredients, purity, dosing associated
with various uses, drug interactions, or any warnings regarding the documented cases of
overdose, hepatic (liver) failure, and possible death; and
WHEREAS, from 2021 to 2023, more than 2,000 fatal kratom-related overdoses were
recorded from forty reporting states and Washington, D.C., and reports of Kratom-only fatal
overdoses are now recorded by medical examiners; and
WHEREAS, Kratom is promoted to have a wide range of benefits and very few side
effects, but this "herbal dietary supplement" is actually banned in two nations where the native
plant is grown, is a controlled substance in at least sixteen countries, and is banned altogether
in Germany, Australia, and Sweden; and
WHEREAS, several states are beginning to regulate the storage, distribution, and sale of
Kratom, while others have outright banned it in any form; and

WHEREAS, states choosing to ban Kratom have added the substance to their lists of
controlled substances as a scheduled drug to reflect its abuse, addiction potential, and reported
side effects; and
WHEREAS, the tragic consequences of the unregulated sale of this substance are
demonstrated by the untimely death of Matthew Davenport, who died on March 18, 2024, from a
lethal interaction between his doctor-prescribed medications and Kratom; and
WHEREAS, Matthew was a kind and thoughtful young man, and although he struggled
with depression, anxiety, and alcohol addiction, he had found support in rehab and a sober-
living home, where he had been thriving; it is indeed a tragedy that his life was cut short by a
harmful, yet unregulated, substance that he purchased as easily as breath mints at a
convenience store; and
WHEREAS, Karen Davenport, his mother and a nurse practitioner, is now leading the
fight to heavily regulate or outright ban the sale of Kratom in Tennessee to end such
preventable tragedies and spare other parents, spouses, and children the unrelenting
devastation of losing a loved one in such a senseless way; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee has led the nation with its careful development of capped
morphine prescriptions, a database to stop doctor shopping, and the closure of pill mills, yet we
still allow the sale of an unregulated compound that is promoted as all-natural, effective, and
safe but in actuality is proving to be addictive and even deadly; and
WHEREAS, our families and communities deserve protection from harmful substances
such as Kratom; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we support the strictest State regulation of Kratom or even an outright ban
on the sale of Kratom in Tennessee.
