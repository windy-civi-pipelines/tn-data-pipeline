development district must be approved by the governing body of each host municipality.
7-84-809. Initiation of process to establish district.
- 4 - 005353
(a) The establishment of a district may be initiated by a petition filed in the office
of the clerk or other officers responsible for keeping the records of the governing body of
each host municipality required to approve the establishment of such district, signed by:
(1) The developer; and
(2) The owners of each parcel of property proposed to be included in the
district.
(b) After the filing of the petition, a petitioning owner is not permitted to withdraw
the petitioner's name from the petition. A petition with the requisite signatures is not void
on account of formal or insubstantial defects. The governing body of each host
municipality, at any time, may permit the petition to be amended to correct any errors in
the description of the territory, or in any other particular. Similar petitions for the
organization of the same district may be filed, and together must be regarded as one (1)
petition with the original. All such petitions filed prior to the hearing on the first petition
filed must be considered by the governing body of each of the host municipalities in the
same manner as if filed with the first petition placed on file.
(c) The initiating petition must set forth:
(1) The name of the proposed district, which must include the words
"Infrastructure Development District";
(2) An identification of each host municipality;
(3) A description of the boundaries of the district or the territory to be
included in the district, identified with sufficient certainty to enable owners to
determine whether their property lies within the district; provided, that the
boundaries must not overlap with the boundaries of another district established
pursuant to this part;
(4) A list of each parcel in the district, identified by parcel identification
number of the county assessor, with the owner of each parcel and the address of

and
(10) A request that a district be established pursuant to this part and that

7-84-810. District area.
(a) An infrastructure development district established pursuant to this part
created by one (1) or more host municipalities may embrace two (2) or more separate
property areas. The jurisdiction of a host municipality to make and provide, finance, and
levy assessments for infrastructure costs within a district is not impaired by a lack of
commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose, or character of the
infrastructure, or by the fact that any one (1) or more of the properties included in the
district are subsequently determined not to be benefited by such infrastructure, or by a
particular portion of the infrastructure, and is not assessed for such infrastructure costs.
(b) The creation or existence of a district is not subject to challenge if any of the
projections of capital costs or other matters contained in the petition are not achieved.
7-84-811. Public hearing requirement.
(a) Upon the filing of an initiating petition purporting to contain the requisite
number of signatures, each governing body of a host municipality required to receive
filing of such petition must order a public hearing to determine whether the infrastructure
development district will be established.
- 6 - 005353
(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), when a district must be approved by two (2)
or more host municipalities, the governing bodies may hold one (1) or more joint public
hearings.
(c) A hearing held pursuant to this section must be held not less than thirty (30)
days, nor more than forty-five (45) days, following the filing of the initiating petition with
the clerk or secretary of the applicable governing body or bodies.
7-84-812. Notice.
(a) Notice of the public hearing must be provided to the public by posting the
notice in a location where a member of the community may become aware of such
notice as well as on a website maintained by the host municipality, if the host
municipality has a website. The notice must provide a summary detailing those facts
required to be included in the initiating petition, but is not required to set out in full the
proposed establishment resolution.
(b) The notice must be posted not less than least fourteen (14) days before the
governing body convenes for the public hearing. The notice must also be provided by
mail to each owner of real property within the proposed district at the address of each
such owner as shown in the records of the county assessor or county trustee for
providing tax notices.
7-84-813. Public hearing procedure.
(a)
(1) All persons whose property may be affected by such improvement
may appear at the public hearing in person, by attorney, or by petition and
protest against the creation of the infrastructure development district. The
governing body shall consider the objections and protests, if any, and may
change the district boundaries or modify the proposal in such manner as may be
deemed advisable by the governing body.
- 7 - 005353
(2) At the conclusion of the public hearing, each applicable governing
body shall adopt, adopt as amended, or reject the organization of the proposed
infrastructure development district by the adoption or rejection of a resolution
setting out the district. In host municipalities requiring two (2) or more readings
before passage of a resolution due to local charter or ordinance requirements, all
required readings must be held prior to the public hearing, except the final
reading, so that the adoption may take place at the conclusion of the public
hearing.
(b) A person who fails to protest, or who fails to appear at the public hearing or
protest, or, having filed a protest, withdraws the protest, is deemed to have waived any
objection to the creation of the district, the making of the improvements, and the
inclusion of the person's property in the district.
(c) An infrastructure development district may only be established by resolution
passed by a majority vote of the members of the governing body present and voting
upon conclusion of the public hearing procedure as set forth in this section.
(d) In the event two (2) or more host municipalities are required to approve the
establishment of an infrastructure development district, and the establishment
resolutions adopted by the governing bodies of such municipalities vary in any material
respect, then the establishment resolutions do not go into effect until one (1) or more of
the governing bodies adopts amendatory resolutions sufficient to cause the
establishment resolutions to be consistent in all material respects.
7-84-814. Establishment resolutions.
The establishment resolution adopted by the governing body of the municipality
must include:
(1) The name of the district as set forth in the original or amended
initiating petition;
(2) An identification of each host municipality;
- 8 - 005353
(3) A description of the boundaries of the district as set out in the original
or amended initiating petition;
(4) A statement that the properties in the area established by the
resolution must be subject to the special assessment;
(5) The name and address of the developer;
(6) A statement of the infrastructure and infrastructure costs authorized
to be funded with special assessment revenues within the district;
(7) The rate of levy of the special assessment to be imposed;
(8) The time and manner in which special assessments authorized by the
resolution must be paid;
(9) The portion of special assessments to be retained by the host
municipality for the payment of administrative expenses, as described in § 7-84-
817; and
(10) A statement that the district is established pursuant to this part and
that the administration of such district is governed by this part.
7-84-815. Bonds, notes, and other obligations.
(a) A host municipality has the authority and power to borrow money and issue
bonds, notes, or other obligations for the purpose of paying infrastructure costs identified
in the establishment resolution, reimbursing the developer for the prior payment of
infrastructure costs, or refunding or refinancing such bonds, notes, or obligations, under
and pursuant to all the procedures and requirements set forth in the Local Government
Public Obligations Act of 1986, compiled in title 9, chapter 21.
(b) A host municipality is further authorized to:
(1) Pledge to the payment of the principal, premium, and interest on the
bonds, notes, or other obligations, and use for the payment of the bonds, notes,
or other obligations the special assessment revenues authorized to be collected
by the host municipality pursuant to this part in the same manner as revenues
- 9 - 005353
may be pledged pursuant to the Local Government Public Obligations Act of

Section 3:
1986. For purposes of this subdivision (b)(1), "revenues" has the same meaning
as defined in § 9-21-105, and includes the special assessment revenues
described in this part;
(2) Delegate to an industrial development corporation incorporated by the
host municipality or another host municipality for the district the authority to issue
the revenue bonds, in which case such host municipality must enter into an
agreement with the industrial development corporation pursuant to which the
host municipality agrees to promptly pay to the industrial development
corporation the assessments, including any interest on the assessments, as
collected. The assessments must be held in trust by the host municipality for the
benefit of the industrial development corporation when received. The host
municipality may direct any property owner that is required to pay assessments
to make the payments directly to an industrial development corporation or its
assignee. If an industrial development corporation issues such bonds, then the
assessments, and any interest collected on the assessments, constitutes
"revenues" as defined in § 7-53-101, and the infrastructure financed thereby,
whether transferred to the industrial development corporation on behalf of the
host municipality, to the host municipality itself, or to another governmental entity
or provider of public utilities, constitutes a project, as that term is defined in § 7-
53-101; and
(3) Delegate to a public building authority the authority to issue the
revenue bonds, in which case the host municipality must enter into an agreement
with the public building authority pursuant to which the host municipality agrees
to promptly pay to the public building authority the assessments, including any
interest on the assessments, collected. The assessments must be held in trust
by the host municipality for the benefit of the public building authority when
- 10 - 005353
received. The host municipality may direct a property owner that is required to
pay an assessment to make the payment directly to a public building authority or
its assignee. If a public building authority issues such bonds, then the
assessments, and any interest collected on the assessments, constitutes
"revenues" as defined in § 12-10-103, and public facilities and related expenses
described in this part, whether transferred to the public building authority on
behalf of the host municipality, to the host municipality itself, or to another
governmental entity or provider of public utilities constitutes a project, as that
term is defined in § 12-10-103.
(c) A host municipality, industrial development corporation, or public building
authority, as the case may be, may:
(1) Refund or refinance or otherwise cause the refunding or refinancing
of any bonds or other obligations issued pursuant to this section in the manner
provided in the Local Government Public Obligations Act of 1986, compiled in
title 9, chapter 21, the Public Building Authorities Act of 1971, compiled in title 12,
chapter 10, or chapter 53 of this title, as applicable. Without limiting this
subdivision (c)(1), a host municipality may refund or refinance any bonds or loan
agreements secured by the full faith and credit of the municipality and revenues
received from assessments with bonds or a loan agreement secured only by
such revenues. Upon any such refunding, the amount of assessment payments
may be adjusted pursuant to policies approved by the host municipality;
provided, that the assessment rate must not exceed that set forth in the
establishment resolution; and
(2) Make the proceeds of bonds, except any bonds secured by the full
faith and credit and taxing power of a municipality, issued pursuant to this section
available to a developer pursuant to one (1) or more loan agreements, and to
- 11 - 005353
assign or pledge the host municipality's rights under the loan agreement to the
holders of the bonds.
(d) The maximum term of any bonds, notes, or other debt obligations issued
pursuant to this section to fund the costs of infrastructure, including any refinancing
bonds, must not exceed thirty (30) years from the first issuance of bonds, notes, or other
debt obligations for the purpose of funding infrastructure.
7-84-816. No limitation on municipal powers.
This part does not limit the powers and authority of the host municipality, this
state, or a political subdivision of this state.
7-84-817. Special assessments.
(a) Upon the filing of a petition in the manner required by § 7-84-809 and the
adoption of an establishment resolution that satisfies § 7-84-814, each host municipality
is authorized to levy special assessments against all properties located within that
portion of the infrastructure development district lying within the boundaries of such host
municipality. When a portion of an infrastructure development district lies within the
boundaries of more than one (1) host municipality, only one (1) of the host municipalities
may levy special assessments in the area, and the identification of the host municipality
responsible for levying assessments for the area must be identified in the establishing
resolution. The proceeds of the special assessments must be applied to the cost of all
infrastructure costs and expenses of making public improvements within the district.
Such costs and expenses may include:
(1) Infrastructure costs;
(2) Impact fees;
(3) Administration expenses required in order to comply with the terms of
this part, including costs incurred to establish the district, abstracts and other title
costs, costs incurred by the host municipality in order to provide for the billing,
- 12 - 005353
collection, and enforcement of special assessments, and the reimbursement of
the developer or host municipalities for the prior payment of such costs; and
(4) The payment of the principal, premium, and interest on any bonds,
notes, or other debt obligations issued pursuant to this part, and the funding of
necessary reserves for debt service, capitalized interest, and costs of issuance
related to any such bonds, notes, or other debt obligations issued.
(b) Any special assessment proceeds in excess of the amounts needed under
subsection (a) must be applied to the defeasance or prepayment of any bonds, notes, or
other obligations issued as provided in this part.
(c)
(1) Special assessments must be levied on the basis and in the amount
set forth in the establishment resolution. The governing body shall determine the
total costs and expenses to be paid from the special assessments, and apportion
such costs and expenses upon the various properties located within the district in
accordance with the benefits conferred upon the various properties.
(2) Special assessments must fairly reflect the benefit received by a lot or
parcel. In determining the benefits to each lot or parcel of property within the
district, the governing body may consider any of the following factors:
(A) Frontage;
(B) Area;
(C) Acreage;
(D) The proportion that the assessed value of each lot or parcel
bears to the whole assessed value of all properties within the district; or
(E) A combination of such factors.
(3) The fact that assessments may be spread uniformly over a large area
within the district is not conclusive that such assessment was arbitrarily made.
(d) Special assessments must be imposed and collected annually.
- 13 - 005353
(e) If special assessment revenue bonds are issued, the minimum ratio of the
appraised value of the property as developed assessed to the amount of the bond issue
is two to one (2:1).
(f) Notwithstanding this part to the contrary, an establishment resolution may
provide that a total of up to five percent (5%) of special assessments be set aside for
administrative expenses, including expenses incurred by the host municipality and the
officers of the municipality, including the assessor of property, trustee, or other tax
collecting official, in administering the collection and allocation of special assessments,
including a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses.
7-84-818. Government-owned property.
Notwithstanding § 7-84-718, a special assessment must not be levied on
government-owned property without the approval of the governing body of the applicable
governmental entity.
7-84-819. Assessment roll.
After all assessments have been determined, the host municipality must prepare
an assessment roll that shows the location of the property and the owner of the property
as shown in the records of the assessor and the amount of the assessment. The
assessment roll must also disclose future annual payments. The assessment roll must
be updated annually and whenever a parcel within the district is subdivided. The host
municipality may include the projected cost of maintaining the assessment roll in the
special assessment.
7-84-820. Administration of assessments.
(a) The governing body of a host municipality is authorized to adopt policies and
procedures that the governing body deems appropriate to administer assessments
imposed under this part, including policies relating to the rate and methodology
governing the implementation of the assessment. The policies and procedures may also
address the reapportionment of assessments upon the request of property owners,
- 14 - 005353
reallocation of assessments upon subdivision of property, credits against assessment
payments based upon other available funds, including earnings on reserve funds,
maintenance of an assessment roll, and procedures for the prepayment of assessments.
The host municipality must provide for full disclosure of an assessment and may
administer penalties for failure to conform to the adopted policies and procedures, as
well as agreed-upon standards.
(b) A host municipality may levy a maximum assessment under this part based
upon the estimated costs of the infrastructure and other permitted costs being assessed,
and, in such case, the amount of the assessment must be reduced by the host
municipality once the actual costs are established by the host municipality. The host
municipality may provide that such assessments may become effective at different
periods of time to take into account when the costs being assessed will be incurred. The
governing body of the host municipality may also provide that assessments must only be
effective upon any issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations imposed or incurred
pursuant to this part.
(c) As long as a district remains in existence, the host municipality must maintain
a record of the general description of the boundaries of such district and the rate of
assessment for properties within such district. The record must be made publicly
available in substantially the same manner as ad valorem property tax rates.
(d) Notwithstanding the fee payable to the host municipality, the host
municipality may contract with outside professional administrators, and such costs may
be included in the assessments.
7-84-821. Prepayment of assessments.
(a) Unless otherwise provided, any assessment may be voluntarily prepaid by
the owner of the land assessed. When a prepayment is made, the amount prepaid must
be applied first to the interest until the first following date on which principal may be paid
under the bond, and then to the principal.
- 15 - 005353
(b) Alternatively, a municipality may require that prepayment must be applied
first to accrued interest, and then to the difference between interest that will accrue from
the date of prepayment until the net principal payment of the bonds, and the rate of
interest at which the principal is paid may be invested to earn interest from the date of
prepayment until the principal payment date, with any remaining balance to be applied to
the principal.
7-84-821. Liens.
(a) An assessment, any interest accruing on the assessment, and the costs of
collection of the assessment constitutes a lien on and against the property upon which
the assessment is levied as of the effective date of the resolution levying the
assessment. The lien is superior to a lien of any trust deed, mortgage, mechanic's or
material supplier's lien, or other encumbrance, except a lien of the state, county, or
municipality for taxes.
(b) Notwithstanding this part to the contrary, amounts collected by the host
municipality must not be allocated to the payment of a special assessment by an owner
in the district until all taxes, penalties, and interest relating to real property taxes
imposed by any governmental entity with the power of taxation, including municipalities
and special school districts, have been paid in full.
(c) The host municipality is authorized to allocate any payment received by an
owner that is designated to pay special assessments to the payment of taxes, penalties,
and interest until such amounts are paid in full. Otherwise, a host municipality shall
collect and enforce special assessments in a district in the same manner as the
collection and enforcement of real property taxes.
7-84-822. Delinquent assessments.
If any assessment is or becomes delinquent and the property subject to the
delinquency has been or is to be sold to the host municipality for the delinquency,
redemption of such property is permitted upon payment, not later than one (1) year after
- 16 - 005353
the date of sale, of the full amount due, plus interest, any taxes paid by the host
municipality, and accrued costs and redemption fees as may be prescribed by resolution
of the host municipality, unless, in the judgment of the governing body of the
municipality, the interest of the host municipality is served by accepting a lesser sum in
settlement for the delinquency.
7-84-823. Interest and penalties.
In case of failure to pay an assessment or installment provided for under this part
on or before the date prescribed by the governing body for such payment, there is added
to the assessment both interest of one percent (1%) per month and a penalty of one
percent (1%) per month of the amount of such assessment or installment.
7-84-824. No operating authority — Compliance with laws.
This part does not authorize, in any manner, the developer or an owner to
operate infrastructure, and the governmental or private entities authorized to provide any
utility service to an area in a district retain the right to provide such service after the
creation of a district. A development agreement entered into pursuant to this part
between a developer and the host municipality may require the dedication or transfer of
all infrastructure by the developer or owner to the appropriate governmental or private
entity that provides the applicable service, and each such governmental or private entity
is authorized to be a party to the development agreement. All infrastructure must be
constructed in a district in compliance with all applicable laws of the applicable
governmental entity.
7-84-825. Joint action amongst host municipalities.
In the case of a district that has two (2) or more host municipalities, the host
municipalities may enter into agreements between or among the host municipalities, and
take collective or cooperative action, as may be required or appropriate to effectuate this
part.
7-84-826. Dissolution of districts.
- 17 - 005353
Each district established pursuant to this part must be dissolved by the governing
bodies of the host municipality, no later than thirty (30) years from the date the district is
established, or if earlier, immediately upon:
(1) Written petition filed by the owners of either seventy-five percent
(75%) of the assessed value of the property in the district, based on the most
recent certified city property tax rolls, or fifty percent (50%) of the owners of
record within the district; or
(2) The payment and discharge of all outstanding bonds, notes, or other
obligations payable solely from the special assessment revenues levied on the
property within the district; provided, that dissolution must not occur prior to the
payment in full and discharge of such debt obligations.
7-84-827. Audit.
(a) All books of accounts and financial records of the district are subject to
annual audit by the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee. The host
municipality shall pay for the cost of any audit.
(b) The comptroller of the treasury shall ensure that audits are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted governmental auditing standards and determine if
the audits meet minimum audit standards prescribed by the comptroller of the treasury.
An audit must not be accepted as meeting the requirements of this section until
approved by the comptroller of the treasury.
(c) All audits must be completed as soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal
year of the host municipality. One (1) copy of each audit must be furnished to each
member of the governing body and the comptroller of the treasury.

following to the end of the section:

may contract with an outside professional administrator and such cost may be
included in the assessment.

Section 5:
SECTION 3. The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not
constitute a part of the law enacted by this act. However, the Tennessee Code Commission is
requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act.

Section 6:

any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or
applications of the act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
that end, the provisions of this act are severable.

development district must be approved by the governing body of each host municipality.
7-84-809. Initiation of process to establish district.
- 4 - 005353

(a) The establishment of a district may be initiated by a petition filed in the office
of the clerk or other officers responsible for keeping the records of the governing body of
each host municipality required to approve the establishment of such district, signed by:
(1) The developer; and
(2) The owners of each parcel of property proposed to be included in the
district.
(b) After the filing of the petition, a petitioning owner is not permitted to withdraw
the petitioner's name from the petition. A petition with the requisite signatures is not void
on account of formal or insubstantial defects. The governing body of each host
municipality, at any time, may permit the petition to be amended to correct any errors in
the description of the territory, or in any other particular. Similar petitions for the
organization of the same district may be filed, and together must be regarded as one (1)
petition with the original. All such petitions filed prior to the hearing on the first petition
filed must be considered by the governing body of each of the host municipalities in the
same manner as if filed with the first petition placed on file.
(c) The initiating petition must set forth:
(1) The name of the proposed district, which must include the words
"Infrastructure Development District";
(2) An identification of each host municipality;
(3) A description of the boundaries of the district or the territory to be
included in the district, identified with sufficient certainty to enable owners to
determine whether their property lies within the district; provided, that the
boundaries must not overlap with the boundaries of another district established
pursuant to this part;
(4) A list of each parcel in the district, identified by parcel identification
number of the county assessor, with the owner of each parcel and the address of
such owner as shown on the property records of the county assessor;

(9) A statement that the petition is filed pursuant to the terms of this part;
and
(10) A request that a district be established pursuant to this part and that
the administration of the district be governed by this part.
7-84-810. District area.
(a) An infrastructure development district established pursuant to this part
created by one (1) or more host municipalities may embrace two (2) or more separate
property areas. The jurisdiction of a host municipality to make and provide, finance, and
levy assessments for infrastructure costs within a district is not impaired by a lack of
commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose, or character of the
infrastructure, or by the fact that any one (1) or more of the properties included in the
district are subsequently determined not to be benefited by such infrastructure, or by a
particular portion of the infrastructure, and is not assessed for such infrastructure costs.
(b) The creation or existence of a district is not subject to challenge if any of the
projections of capital costs or other matters contained in the petition are not achieved.
7-84-811. Public hearing requirement.
(a) Upon the filing of an initiating petition purporting to contain the requisite
number of signatures, each governing body of a host municipality required to receive
filing of such petition must order a public hearing to determine whether the infrastructure
development district will be established.
- 6 - 005353

(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), when a district must be approved by two (2)
or more host municipalities, the governing bodies may hold one (1) or more joint public
hearings.
(c) A hearing held pursuant to this section must be held not less than thirty (30)
days, nor more than forty-five (45) days, following the filing of the initiating petition with
the clerk or secretary of the applicable governing body or bodies.
7-84-812. Notice.
(a) Notice of the public hearing must be provided to the public by posting the
notice in a location where a member of the community may become aware of such
notice as well as on a website maintained by the host municipality, if the host
municipality has a website. The notice must provide a summary detailing those facts
required to be included in the initiating petition, but is not required to set out in full the
proposed establishment resolution.
(b) The notice must be posted not less than least fourteen (14) days before the
governing body convenes for the public hearing. The notice must also be provided by
mail to each owner of real property within the proposed district at the address of each
such owner as shown in the records of the county assessor or county trustee for
providing tax notices.
7-84-813. Public hearing procedure.
(a)
(1) All persons whose property may be affected by such improvement
may appear at the public hearing in person, by attorney, or by petition and
protest against the creation of the infrastructure development district. The
governing body shall consider the objections and protests, if any, and may
change the district boundaries or modify the proposal in such manner as may be
deemed advisable by the governing body.
- 7 - 005353

(2) At the conclusion of the public hearing, each applicable governing
body shall adopt, adopt as amended, or reject the organization of the proposed
infrastructure development district by the adoption or rejection of a resolution
setting out the district. In host municipalities requiring two (2) or more readings
before passage of a resolution due to local charter or ordinance requirements, all
required readings must be held prior to the public hearing, except the final
reading, so that the adoption may take place at the conclusion of the public
hearing.
(b) A person who fails to protest, or who fails to appear at the public hearing or
protest, or, having filed a protest, withdraws the protest, is deemed to have waived any
objection to the creation of the district, the making of the improvements, and the
inclusion of the person's property in the district.
(c) An infrastructure development district may only be established by resolution
passed by a majority vote of the members of the governing body present and voting
upon conclusion of the public hearing procedure as set forth in this section.
(d) In the event two (2) or more host municipalities are required to approve the
establishment of an infrastructure development district, and the establishment
resolutions adopted by the governing bodies of such municipalities vary in any material
respect, then the establishment resolutions do not go into effect until one (1) or more of
the governing bodies adopts amendatory resolutions sufficient to cause the
establishment resolutions to be consistent in all material respects.
7-84-814. Establishment resolutions.
The establishment resolution adopted by the governing body of the municipality
must include:
(1) The name of the district as set forth in the original or amended
initiating petition;
(2) An identification of each host municipality;
- 8 - 005353

(3) A description of the boundaries of the district as set out in the original
or amended initiating petition;
(4) A statement that the properties in the area established by the
resolution must be subject to the special assessment;
(5) The name and address of the developer;
(6) A statement of the infrastructure and infrastructure costs authorized
to be funded with special assessment revenues within the district;
(7) The rate of levy of the special assessment to be imposed;
(8) The time and manner in which special assessments authorized by the
resolution must be paid;
(9) The portion of special assessments to be retained by the host
municipality for the payment of administrative expenses, as described in § 7-84-
817; and
(10) A statement that the district is established pursuant to this part and
that the administration of such district is governed by this part.
7-84-815. Bonds, notes, and other obligations.
(a) A host municipality has the authority and power to borrow money and issue
bonds, notes, or other obligations for the purpose of paying infrastructure costs identified
in the establishment resolution, reimbursing the developer for the prior payment of
infrastructure costs, or refunding or refinancing such bonds, notes, or obligations, under
and pursuant to all the procedures and requirements set forth in the Local Government
Public Obligations Act of 1986, compiled in title 9, chapter 21.
(b) A host municipality is further authorized to:
(1) Pledge to the payment of the principal, premium, and interest on the
bonds, notes, or other obligations, and use for the payment of the bonds, notes,
or other obligations the special assessment revenues authorized to be collected
by the host municipality pursuant to this part in the same manner as revenues
- 9 - 005353

may be pledged pursuant to the Local Government Public Obligations Act of
1986. For purposes of this subdivision (b)(1), "revenues" has the same meaning
as defined in § 9-21-105, and includes the special assessment revenues
described in this part;
(2) Delegate to an industrial development corporation incorporated by the
host municipality or another host municipality for the district the authority to issue
the revenue bonds, in which case such host municipality must enter into an
agreement with the industrial development corporation pursuant to which the
host municipality agrees to promptly pay to the industrial development
corporation the assessments, including any interest on the assessments, as
collected. The assessments must be held in trust by the host municipality for the
benefit of the industrial development corporation when received. The host
municipality may direct any property owner that is required to pay assessments
to make the payments directly to an industrial development corporation or its
assignee. If an industrial development corporation issues such bonds, then the
assessments, and any interest collected on the assessments, constitutes
"revenues" as defined in § 7-53-101, and the infrastructure financed thereby,
whether transferred to the industrial development corporation on behalf of the
host municipality, to the host municipality itself, or to another governmental entity
or provider of public utilities, constitutes a project, as that term is defined in § 7-
53-101; and
(3) Delegate to a public building authority the authority to issue the
revenue bonds, in which case the host municipality must enter into an agreement
with the public building authority pursuant to which the host municipality agrees
to promptly pay to the public building authority the assessments, including any
interest on the assessments, collected. The assessments must be held in trust
by the host municipality for the benefit of the public building authority when
- 10 - 005353

received. The host municipality may direct a property owner that is required to
pay an assessment to make the payment directly to a public building authority or
its assignee. If a public building authority issues such bonds, then the
assessments, and any interest collected on the assessments, constitutes
"revenues" as defined in § 12-10-103, and public facilities and related expenses
described in this part, whether transferred to the public building authority on
behalf of the host municipality, to the host municipality itself, or to another
governmental entity or provider of public utilities constitutes a project, as that
term is defined in § 12-10-103.
(c) A host municipality, industrial development corporation, or public building
authority, as the case may be, may:
(1) Refund or refinance or otherwise cause the refunding or refinancing
of any bonds or other obligations issued pursuant to this section in the manner
provided in the Local Government Public Obligations Act of 1986, compiled in
title 9, chapter 21, the Public Building Authorities Act of 1971, compiled in title 12,
chapter 10, or chapter 53 of this title, as applicable. Without limiting this
subdivision (c)(1), a host municipality may refund or refinance any bonds or loan
agreements secured by the full faith and credit of the municipality and revenues
received from assessments with bonds or a loan agreement secured only by
such revenues. Upon any such refunding, the amount of assessment payments
may be adjusted pursuant to policies approved by the host municipality;
provided, that the assessment rate must not exceed that set forth in the
establishment resolution; and
(2) Make the proceeds of bonds, except any bonds secured by the full
faith and credit and taxing power of a municipality, issued pursuant to this section
available to a developer pursuant to one (1) or more loan agreements, and to
- 11 - 005353

assign or pledge the host municipality's rights under the loan agreement to the
holders of the bonds.
(d) The maximum term of any bonds, notes, or other debt obligations issued
pursuant to this section to fund the costs of infrastructure, including any refinancing
bonds, must not exceed thirty (30) years from the first issuance of bonds, notes, or other
debt obligations for the purpose of funding infrastructure.
7-84-816. No limitation on municipal powers.
This part does not limit the powers and authority of the host municipality, this
state, or a political subdivision of this state.
7-84-817. Special assessments.
(a) Upon the filing of a petition in the manner required by § 7-84-809 and the
adoption of an establishment resolution that satisfies § 7-84-814, each host municipality
is authorized to levy special assessments against all properties located within that
portion of the infrastructure development district lying within the boundaries of such host
municipality. When a portion of an infrastructure development district lies within the
boundaries of more than one (1) host municipality, only one (1) of the host municipalities
may levy special assessments in the area, and the identification of the host municipality
responsible for levying assessments for the area must be identified in the establishing
resolution. The proceeds of the special assessments must be applied to the cost of all
infrastructure costs and expenses of making public improvements within the district.
Such costs and expenses may include:
(1) Infrastructure costs;
(2) Impact fees;
(3) Administration expenses required in order to comply with the terms of
this part, including costs incurred to establish the district, abstracts and other title
costs, costs incurred by the host municipality in order to provide for the billing,
- 12 - 005353

collection, and enforcement of special assessments, and the reimbursement of
the developer or host municipalities for the prior payment of such costs; and
(4) The payment of the principal, premium, and interest on any bonds,
notes, or other debt obligations issued pursuant to this part, and the funding of
necessary reserves for debt service, capitalized interest, and costs of issuance
related to any such bonds, notes, or other debt obligations issued.
(b) Any special assessment proceeds in excess of the amounts needed under
subsection (a) must be applied to the defeasance or prepayment of any bonds, notes, or
other obligations issued as provided in this part.
(c)
(1) Special assessments must be levied on the basis and in the amount
set forth in the establishment resolution. The governing body shall determine the
total costs and expenses to be paid from the special assessments, and apportion
such costs and expenses upon the various properties located within the district in
accordance with the benefits conferred upon the various properties.
(2) Special assessments must fairly reflect the benefit received by a lot or
parcel. In determining the benefits to each lot or parcel of property within the
district, the governing body may consider any of the following factors:
(A) Frontage;
(B) Area;
(C) Acreage;
(D) The proportion that the assessed value of each lot or parcel
bears to the whole assessed value of all properties within the district; or
(E) A combination of such factors.
(3) The fact that assessments may be spread uniformly over a large area
within the district is not conclusive that such assessment was arbitrarily made.
(d) Special assessments must be imposed and collected annually.
- 13 - 005353

(e) If special assessment revenue bonds are issued, the minimum ratio of the
appraised value of the property as developed assessed to the amount of the bond issue
is two to one (2:1).
(f) Notwithstanding this part to the contrary, an establishment resolution may
provide that a total of up to five percent (5%) of special assessments be set aside for
administrative expenses, including expenses incurred by the host municipality and the
officers of the municipality, including the assessor of property, trustee, or other tax
collecting official, in administering the collection and allocation of special assessments,
including a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses.
7-84-818. Government-owned property.
Notwithstanding § 7-84-718, a special assessment must not be levied on
government-owned property without the approval of the governing body of the applicable
governmental entity.
7-84-819. Assessment roll.
After all assessments have been determined, the host municipality must prepare
an assessment roll that shows the location of the property and the owner of the property
as shown in the records of the assessor and the amount of the assessment. The
assessment roll must also disclose future annual payments. The assessment roll must
be updated annually and whenever a parcel within the district is subdivided. The host
municipality may include the projected cost of maintaining the assessment roll in the
special assessment.
7-84-820. Administration of assessments.
(a) The governing body of a host municipality is authorized to adopt policies and
procedures that the governing body deems appropriate to administer assessments
imposed under this part, including policies relating to the rate and methodology
governing the implementation of the assessment. The policies and procedures may also
address the reapportionment of assessments upon the request of property owners,
- 14 - 005353

reallocation of assessments upon subdivision of property, credits against assessment
payments based upon other available funds, including earnings on reserve funds,
maintenance of an assessment roll, and procedures for the prepayment of assessments.
The host municipality must provide for full disclosure of an assessment and may
administer penalties for failure to conform to the adopted policies and procedures, as
well as agreed-upon standards.
(b) A host municipality may levy a maximum assessment under this part based
upon the estimated costs of the infrastructure and other permitted costs being assessed,
and, in such case, the amount of the assessment must be reduced by the host
municipality once the actual costs are established by the host municipality. The host
municipality may provide that such assessments may become effective at different
periods of time to take into account when the costs being assessed will be incurred. The
governing body of the host municipality may also provide that assessments must only be
effective upon any issuance of bonds, notes, or other obligations imposed or incurred
pursuant to this part.
(c) As long as a district remains in existence, the host municipality must maintain
a record of the general description of the boundaries of such district and the rate of
assessment for properties within such district. The record must be made publicly
available in substantially the same manner as ad valorem property tax rates.
(d) Notwithstanding the fee payable to the host municipality, the host
municipality may contract with outside professional administrators, and such costs may
be included in the assessments.
7-84-821. Prepayment of assessments.
(a) Unless otherwise provided, any assessment may be voluntarily prepaid by
the owner of the land assessed. When a prepayment is made, the amount prepaid must
be applied first to the interest until the first following date on which principal may be paid
under the bond, and then to the principal.
- 15 - 005353

(b) Alternatively, a municipality may require that prepayment must be applied
first to accrued interest, and then to the difference between interest that will accrue from
the date of prepayment until the net principal payment of the bonds, and the rate of
interest at which the principal is paid may be invested to earn interest from the date of
prepayment until the principal payment date, with any remaining balance to be applied to
the principal.
7-84-821. Liens.
(a) An assessment, any interest accruing on the assessment, and the costs of
collection of the assessment constitutes a lien on and against the property upon which
the assessment is levied as of the effective date of the resolution levying the
assessment. The lien is superior to a lien of any trust deed, mortgage, mechanic's or
material supplier's lien, or other encumbrance, except a lien of the state, county, or
municipality for taxes.
(b) Notwithstanding this part to the contrary, amounts collected by the host
municipality must not be allocated to the payment of a special assessment by an owner
in the district until all taxes, penalties, and interest relating to real property taxes
imposed by any governmental entity with the power of taxation, including municipalities
and special school districts, have been paid in full.
(c) The host municipality is authorized to allocate any payment received by an
owner that is designated to pay special assessments to the payment of taxes, penalties,
and interest until such amounts are paid in full. Otherwise, a host municipality shall
collect and enforce special assessments in a district in the same manner as the
collection and enforcement of real property taxes.
7-84-822. Delinquent assessments.
If any assessment is or becomes delinquent and the property subject to the
delinquency has been or is to be sold to the host municipality for the delinquency,
redemption of such property is permitted upon payment, not later than one (1) year after
- 16 - 005353

the date of sale, of the full amount due, plus interest, any taxes paid by the host
municipality, and accrued costs and redemption fees as may be prescribed by resolution
of the host municipality, unless, in the judgment of the governing body of the
municipality, the interest of the host municipality is served by accepting a lesser sum in
settlement for the delinquency.
7-84-823. Interest and penalties.
In case of failure to pay an assessment or installment provided for under this part
on or before the date prescribed by the governing body for such payment, there is added
to the assessment both interest of one percent (1%) per month and a penalty of one
percent (1%) per month of the amount of such assessment or installment.
7-84-824. No operating authority — Compliance with laws.
This part does not authorize, in any manner, the developer or an owner to
operate infrastructure, and the governmental or private entities authorized to provide any
utility service to an area in a district retain the right to provide such service after the
creation of a district. A development agreement entered into pursuant to this part
between a developer and the host municipality may require the dedication or transfer of
all infrastructure by the developer or owner to the appropriate governmental or private
entity that provides the applicable service, and each such governmental or private entity
is authorized to be a party to the development agreement. All infrastructure must be
constructed in a district in compliance with all applicable laws of the applicable
governmental entity.
7-84-825. Joint action amongst host municipalities.
In the case of a district that has two (2) or more host municipalities, the host
municipalities may enter into agreements between or among the host municipalities, and
take collective or cooperative action, as may be required or appropriate to effectuate this
part.
7-84-826. Dissolution of districts.
- 17 - 005353

Each district established pursuant to this part must be dissolved by the governing
bodies of the host municipality, no later than thirty (30) years from the date the district is
established, or if earlier, immediately upon:
(1) Written petition filed by the owners of either seventy-five percent
(75%) of the assessed value of the property in the district, based on the most
recent certified city property tax rolls, or fifty percent (50%) of the owners of
record within the district; or
(2) The payment and discharge of all outstanding bonds, notes, or other
obligations payable solely from the special assessment revenues levied on the
property within the district; provided, that dissolution must not occur prior to the
payment in full and discharge of such debt obligations.
7-84-827. Audit.
(a) All books of accounts and financial records of the district are subject to
annual audit by the comptroller of the treasury or the comptroller's designee. The host
municipality shall pay for the cost of any audit.
(b) The comptroller of the treasury shall ensure that audits are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted governmental auditing standards and determine if
the audits meet minimum audit standards prescribed by the comptroller of the treasury.
An audit must not be accepted as meeting the requirements of this section until
approved by the comptroller of the treasury.
(c) All audits must be completed as soon as practicable after the end of the fiscal
year of the host municipality. One (1) copy of each audit must be furnished to each
member of the governing body and the comptroller of the treasury.
SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 7-84-720, is amended by adding the
following to the end of the section:
- 18 - 005353

Notwithstanding the fee payable to the host municipality, the host municipality
may contract with an outside professional administrator and such cost may be
included in the assessment.
SECTION 3. The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not
constitute a part of the law enacted by this act. However, the Tennessee Code Commission is
requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act.
SECTION 4. If any provision of this act or the application of any provision of this act to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or
applications of the act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
that end, the provisions of this act are severable.
