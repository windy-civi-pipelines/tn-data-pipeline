A RESOLUTION to honor Trooper Eric Pincince on the occasion
of his retirement.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal concerns to ensure the public's safety and welfare, and the Volunteer State is
especially proud to be the home of so many valiant individuals; and
WHEREAS, one such individual is Trooper Eric Pincince of the Tennessee Highway
Patrol, who has rendered sterling service to the people of the State of Tennessee for thirty years
and will be taking his much-deserved retirement; and

several accolades for his detailed crash investigations and consistent, concerted DUI
enforcement, and he has been recognized by Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his tireless
efforts spent in battling impaired driving; and
WHEREAS, Trooper Pincince, working closely with the United States Marshals, has
been indispensable in the fight for a safe and just society, and during his tenure, he has helped
to capture dangerous fugitives and arrest a domestic terrorist; and
WHEREAS, he has spent the last season of his career span protecting the State Capitol,
a task he has performed dutifully and honorably since 2016; and

commits his time to fostering his family life with his beloved wife and two children; and
