HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 148
By Helton-Haynes
A RESOLUTION to recognize Bea's Restaurant upon its seventy-
fifth anniversary.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should pay tribute to those fine dining
establishments that serve the gastronomical needs of our citizens, while also delighting their
taste buds; and;
WHEREAS, Bea's Restaurant in Chattanooga is one such outstanding restaurant that
has attracted a diverse and loyal clientele by providing delicious cuisine and attentive service to
its many loyal patrons for seventy-five years; and
WHEREAS, this exceptional restaurant first opened its doors in 1950 and has served the
residents of Chattanooga for almost eight decades; and
WHEREAS, the late Bill and Beatrice Steele opened Bea's Restaurant in Chattanooga in
1950 as a small establishment, having just one dining room with a handful of tables and an
apartment on the second floor where the Steeles lived; and
WHEREAS, from these humble beginnings, Bea's Restaurant has grown and prospered
over the past seventy-five years by serving outstanding food with fellowship and exceptional
service; and
WHEREAS, when Bea's first opened, it was patronized frequently by plant workers, who
needed to get in and out quickly on their lunch breaks; accommodating that need, Mr. and Mrs.
Steele installed the restaurant's signature lazy Susans; and
WHEREAS, those lazy Susans still offer the same fried chicken, sweet tea, and other
Southern favorites, many of which are prepared from Mrs. Steele's original recipes; and

WHEREAS, although prices for the exquisite cuisine at Bea's restaurant have risen since
the days when seventy-five cents bought an all-you-can-eat meal, the restaurant has stayed in
the family; Bernice and H.L. Bradshaw, the Steeles' daughter and son-in-law, took over after Mr.
and Mrs. Steele retired; and
WHEREAS, now a fourth-generation business, Bea's is currently run by Doug Bradshaw,
the Steeles' grandson, along with his son Dusty, his brother Mike, and Mike's sons Stacey and
Bryan; and
WHEREAS, through the generations, the Steele and Bradshaw families, utilizing their
determination and strong work ethic, have built an excellent reputation for fine Southern food
and down-home hospitality, helping to create the iconic nature of Bea's Restaurant; and
WHEREAS, with its dishes prepared from scratch Wednesdays through Sundays
beginning at 5:00 in the morning, Bea's Restaurant has long been a gathering place for the
residents of Chattanooga, and its doors are always open to anyone who is hungry; and
WHEREAS, during its seventy-five years of existence, Bea's Restaurant has been the
scene of many first dates, work lunches, and family dinners throughout its illustrious history; and
WHEREAS, the outstanding success and stellar reputation that Bea's Restaurant has
attained would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the Steele and
Bradshaw families and loyal staff members, who represent some of the finest restaurant
industry minds in Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, Bea's Restaurant always serves its food with a side order of friendship and
fond memories for every person who enters the eatery; and
WHEREAS, the good people of Chattanooga greatly appreciate the valuable contribution
that the Steele and Bradshaw families and their staff are making to the dining experience in their
community and have honored Bea's Restaurant with their patronage over the many decades;
now, therefore,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend the owners, staff, and management of Bea's
Restaurant upon its seventy-fifth anniversary, applaud them for their delectable meals and
