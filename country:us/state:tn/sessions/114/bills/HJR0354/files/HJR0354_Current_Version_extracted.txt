tournament; and
WHEREAS, in the championship game, the Lady Bears clipped the wings of the Green
Hill Lady Hawks by a score of 59-54 to bring home the gold; and
WHEREAS, Mt. Juliet relied heavily upon the talent, competitive spirit, and leadership of
the tournament's Most Valuable Player, McClaine Ringenberg, who led the Lady Bears to the

WHEREAS, also contributing significantly to the Lady Bears' title run were Claire Emery,
Aaliyah Holman, Addy Osborne, Isabella Craig, Makayla Hopson, Sophia McGresham, Carlie
Scurlock, Sara Valencia, Madison Davenport, Ava Grisham, Lilly Bugg, and Lilli Kerney; and
