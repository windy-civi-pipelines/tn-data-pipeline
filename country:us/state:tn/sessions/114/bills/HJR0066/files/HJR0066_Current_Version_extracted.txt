Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 66
By Cepicky
A RESOLUTION to encourage each local education agency that
operates a high school to participate in the
Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery
Career Exploration Program.
WHEREAS, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery or ASVAB tests are
designed to measure aptitudes via ten tests in four domains: verbal, math, science, and
technical, and spatial with all testing completed in an average time of ninety minutes; and
WHEREAS, many students in Tennessee may not know they have the opportunity to
take the ASVAB and consider the many meaningful career options available in the armed forces
of the United States or the Tennessee Army and Air National Guard; and
WHEREAS, while most ASVAB testing is conducted at a Military Entrance Processing
Station, or satellite stations, the ASVAB is also offered to high school and post-secondary
students as part of the Department of Defense sponsored ASVAB Career Exploration Program
(CEP); and
WHEREAS, participation in this program does not cost the school districts anything; and
WHEREAS, the ASVAB CEP offers students a chance to explore all paths to careers,
including college, certifications, apprenticeships, licensure programs, and the military in one
place; and
WHEREAS, ASVAB participation is encouraged through both state and federal
accountability measures for college and career readiness for every school district; and
WHEREAS, encouraging students to participate in this career aptitude assessment
provides the student and parent valuable insight into career paths in either civilian or military life;
now, therefore,
