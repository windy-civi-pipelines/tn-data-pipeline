HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 551
By Hakeem
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Moccasin Bend Mental
Health Institute's Bleyzer Program.
WHEREAS, it is the privilege of this General Assembly to recognize those premier
medical facilities and their programs that compassionately and capably serve the citizens of this
State; and
WHEREAS, one such facility is Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute (MBMHI) of
Chattanooga, a psychiatric hospital and one of four Regional Mental Health Institutes operated
by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, which serves fifty-two
counties in East Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, MBMHI's Bleyzer Program was recently recognized by The Rutgers Institute
for Inpatient Psychiatric Rehabilitation, garnering the first annual IIPR Award, which recognizes
Bleyzer as an innovative program that embodies the goals, values, and principles of psychiatric
rehabilitation in adult inpatient settings; and
WHEREAS, established in 2020, the Bleyzer Program was designed to serve patients
who have been in the clinical inpatient setting for an extended period of time, helping to prepare
them for discharge and community reintegration; and
WHEREAS, using a "community living" approach, the program is designed to help
patients develop coping skills to manage their mental illness; and
WHEREAS, patients gain or refine independent living skills, confidence, and self-
esteem, all while working toward individual goals and obtaining the tools needed to function
within their community upon discharge; patients work together to complete chores and plan and
prepare meals, including shopping in the community; and

WHEREAS, the express mission of the program is to "Blaze new trails back into the
community through facilitation and practice of vocation, support, and knowledge of recovery";

graduated from the program; only three of the patients returned to the program, for medication
adjustment or need for new placement, and the length of stay was less than one month; and
WHEREAS, the Bleyzer Program benefits from the knowledge, care, and dedication of
staff members John Gonzales, Arlisa Good, Spring Hughes, and Anthony Johnson; and
WHEREAS, Moccasin Bend Mental Health Institute's Bleyzer Program serves the
Eastern Grand Division with compassionate care and has been vital to the well-being of its
citizens; now, therefore,

FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
