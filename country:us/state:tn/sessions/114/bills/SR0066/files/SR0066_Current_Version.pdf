SENATE RESOLUTION 66
By Massey
A RESOLUTION to recognize and commemorate Honor Our
Great Smoky Mountain Veterans Day on June
14, 2025.
WHEREAS, the contributions and sacrifices of the men and women who have served in
the U.S. Armed Forces have been vital in maintaining our freedoms and way of life; and
WHEREAS, we will never forget the sacrifices these men and women made for our
country, including the ultimate sacrifice in many cases; and
WHEREAS, our veterans are brave and selfless individuals who, when duty called,
willingly put themselves in harm's way to defend the lives and liberty of others; their abiding
patriotism and enduring devotion to the ideals on which the United States was founded never
fails to inspire; and
WHEREAS, tens of millions of Americans have served in the Armed Forces of the
United States from the American Revolution to the present; many of those veterans chose to
settle and start their families in East Tennessee, and many of them forfeited their land to found
one of the best national parks in the United States; and
WHEREAS, on June 14, 2025, Veterans Heritage Site Foundation (VHSF) will host
Honor Our Great Smoky Mountain Veterans Day to honor the more than 249 veterans who are
buried at more than sixty-five sites within Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP); and
WHEREAS, this year's event will specifically honor War of 1812 veterans who are buried
within GSMNP and surrounding cemeteries and their descendants; and
WHEREAS, nine War of 1812 veterans are buried in the park, including Peter Cable,
John Calhoun, Hugh Ghormley, James Greet, John Mingus, John Oliver, John Ownby, William
Threntham, and William Whaley; and

WHEREAS, on this special day, VHSF, honored guests, speakers, and other attendees
will pay homage to two additional events celebrated on June 14, 2025, namely the 250th
anniversary of the U.S. Army and Flag Day; and
WHEREAS, we are most grateful to VHSF and the Tennessee chapters of the
Daughters of the American Revolution and the National Society United States Daughters of
1812 for their commitment to honoring GSMNP veterans on this day and every day; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we recognize and
commemorate Honor Our Great Smoky Mountain Veterans Day on June 14, 2025, and honor
the military service of Great Smoky Mountains National Park veterans from all conflicts.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
