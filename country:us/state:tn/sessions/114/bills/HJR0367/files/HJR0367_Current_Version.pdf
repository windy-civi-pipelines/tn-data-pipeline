HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 367
By Reedy
A RESOLUTION to honor WQMV upon its twentieth anniversary.
WHEREAS, local radio stations have been important community cultural institutions
since the early days of the radio industry, as the new medium brought local, national, and world
events to listeners in a timely fashion and opened doors to music, sports, weather, and other
features; and
WHEREAS, WQMV, owned by Dean and Connie Duke, is one such vital station, which,
for twenty years, has served as a beacon of local news and entertainment for the residents of
Humphreys County; and
WHEREAS, WQMV AM 1060 signed on the air in May 2005 under the ownership of C &
L Broadcasting; in 2006, DCDL Media, which is owned by Dean and Connie Duke, was brought
in to manage the daily operations; and
WHEREAS, DCDL Media selected a classic rock music format for the station and made
use of online streaming to provide coverage of the sports teams of Humphreys County's two
high schools; and
WHEREAS, in 2010, C & L Broadcasting ceased operational service to Humphreys
County and allowed the frequency to go silent before DCDL Media entered into a licensing
agreement in March 2010 to take over the station's operating expenses and other obligations,
keeping WQMV on the air; and
WHEREAS, DCDL Media purchased the station in March 2011 and petitioned the FCC
to acquire its license, with DCDL becoming the officially licensed owner of the radio station on
July 1, 2011; and

WHEREAS, in 2016, DCDL took steps to acquire an FM translator and relocate it to
Waverly as part of the FCC's AM revitalization program; subsequently, it became one of the first
stations in Tennessee to be approved for the program, as the FCC gave DCDL Media six
months to have the new FM translator operational; and
WHEREAS, on July 4, 2016, FM translator W228DG was added, providing FM service in
WQMV's coverage area of Humphreys, Houston, Benton, and parts of Dickson counties; and
WHEREAS, today, WQMV AM 1060 and FM 93.5 continue to provide community affairs,
sports, and musical programming to the listeners in its coverage area and serve as the
emergency management information provider for Humphreys County; and
WHEREAS, for twenty years, WQMV has provided countless hours of reliable
information, quality entertainment, and caring public service to thousands of listeners and has
earned a hallowed place in the hearts of its patrons; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor WQMV and owners Dean and Connie Duke on the occasion of
the station's twentieth anniversary, extending to this important institution our best wishes for
much continued success.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
