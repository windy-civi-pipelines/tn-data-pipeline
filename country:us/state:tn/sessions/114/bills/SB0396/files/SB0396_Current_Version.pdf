following new subsections:
(o) Notwithstanding this section to the contrary, the governor shall not issue a

extend such state of emergency by joint resolution of both houses.

emergency, an ad hoc legislative council is established for the duration of

deleting the second sentence and substituting:
The state of emergency continues until the governor finds that the threat or
danger has been dealt with to the extent that the emergency conditions no longer
exist and the governor terminates the state of emergency by executive order or
proclamation, but no state of emergency may continue for longer than thirty (30)
days unless renewed by the general assembly or the legislative council pursuant
to subsection (p), as applicable.
SECTION 3. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it,
and applies to states of emergency declared by executive order or proclaimed by the governor
on or after such date.
