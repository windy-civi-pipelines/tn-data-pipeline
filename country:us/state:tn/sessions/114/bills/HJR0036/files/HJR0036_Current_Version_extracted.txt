Air Refueling Wing at McGhee Tyson Air
National Guard Base in Knoxville as it
endeavors to be chosen by the U.S. Air Force to
receive the next generation of air refueling
aircraft, the KC-46 Pegasus.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal safety and concerns to ensure our individual and collective freedom, and the Volunteer
State is especially proud to be the home of so many valiant men and women who continue to
perform above and beyond the call of duty in the Tennessee Air National Guard; and
WHEREAS, truly displaying the Volunteer Spirit are the men and women of the 134th Air
Refueling Wing of the Tennessee Air National Guard assigned to McGhee Tyson Air National
Guard Base in Knoxville, where they have served our nation with distinction for many years; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Air Force has developed a new tanker aircraft, designated the KC-
46 Pegasus, a modern aircraft to replace the aging air refueling fleet of KC-135s, which first
entered service in 1957; and
WHEREAS, it is our understanding that the Tennessee Air National Guard's 134th Air
Refueling Wing is in competition with many other states to receive the new KC-46 Pegasus
refueling aircraft and extend their mission into the next several decades; and
WHEREAS, McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base in Knoxville is uniquely qualified to
receive and employ the Air Force's next generation of air refueling aircraft due to its strategic
location, robust infrastructure, and highly proficient Volunteer Airmen; and
