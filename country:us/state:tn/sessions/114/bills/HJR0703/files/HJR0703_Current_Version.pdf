college education to deserving youth through scholarships, sponsoring local charitable
organizations, and honoring worthy local citizens, and the Jamestown Rotary is no different; and

WHEREAS, Jamestown Rotarians also host annual events that raise funds for club
projects or serve to build community, including the Chicken Festival, Car Show, Chicken Run,
Field of Flags/Flags for Heroes, Christmas Ornament Sale, Christmas Parade, and Reindeer
Dash, as well as the Children's Shopping Spree Radio-Thon, which raises an average of
$25,000 each year for local children prior to the Christmas season; and
WHEREAS, the Jamestown Rotary provides scholarships annually to the winner of the
Miss Upper Cumberland Pageant and to seniors at Clarkrange High School and York Institute;
the club also donates to Handfuls of Harvest Food Kitchen and Blessing Box, Fentress County
Children's Center, and local sports teams; and
WHEREAS, a recent club project that greatly benefited the community was the effort to
upgrade Mark Twain Park, providing new railing, signage, picnic tables, and lighting, as well as
updated landscaping, a new roof at the springs, and the addition of a Book Library and a
bookworm metal art display; and
WHEREAS, throughout its eight-decade history, the club has remained committed to
Rotary's motto, "Service Above Self," and it continues to be highly regarded throughout
Jamestown for its many contributions to the community; and
WHEREAS, as the Jamestown Rotary Club celebrates its rich history of public service, it
is appropriate to honor the many club members, both past and present, who have volunteered
their time, talent, and resources in order to serve their community and fellow citizens; and
WHEREAS, the Jamestown Rotary Club is most assuredly worthy of our recognition and
approbation on this special occasion; now, therefore,
