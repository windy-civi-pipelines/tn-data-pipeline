AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4;
Title 38, Chapter 3; Title 39, Chapter 17; Title 43;
Title 50; Title 53; Title 63; Title 67 and Title 68,
relative to the "Tennessee Medical Cannabis Act."
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:

Section 2:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 68, Chapter 7, is amended by adding

Section 3:
Sections 2 through 24 as a new part.

Section 4:
SECTION 2. This part is known and may be cited as the "Tennessee Medical Cannabis
Act."

Section 5:
SECTION 3.
The general assembly intends to establish a functional framework within which to
authorize access to medical cannabis on a regulated basis for patients with qualifying
medical conditions and which licenses and regulates the processes for cultivating,
producing, distributing, transporting, selling, and acquiring cannabis for medical use and
research. The broad purpose of the Tennessee Medical Cannabis Act is to increase
low-cost public health options, alleviate suffering, develop agricultural business,
incentivize research of THC benefits, and expeditiously license and track medical
cannabis from cultivation to point of sale within the boundaries of this state. The general
assembly recognizes that as of 2024, thirty-eight (38) states, including Tennessee
border states Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Virginia, have exercised
their Tenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution, and have been
supported by the federal government in the exercise of these rights intrastate with the
inclusion of the Rohrabacher amendment in the federal omnibus budget bill each year
HB0872
001239
- 1 -
since 2014, and legalized access to medical cannabis for many medical conditions.
More than two-thirds (2/3) of the population in the United States currently have access to
legal medical cannabis through other authorized state programs. Additionally, the
general assembly recognizes that peer-reviewed medical studies have established a
statistical correlation between reduced opioid-use overdoses in states with medical
cannabis programs.

low-cost public health options, alleviate suffering, develop agricultural business,
incentivize research of THC benefits, and expeditiously license and track medical
cannabis from cultivation to point of sale within the boundaries of this state. The general
assembly recognizes that as of 2024, thirty-eight (38) states, including Tennessee
border states Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Virginia, have exercised
their Tenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution, and have been
supported by the federal government in the exercise of these rights intrastate with the
inclusion of the Rohrabacher amendment in the federal omnibus budget bill each year

More than two-thirds (2/3) of the population in the United States currently have access to

(A) Placing or modifying a limit on the number of licenses that it
issues, by class or overall, but in placing or modifying the limits, the
commission shall consider the reasonable availability of new licenses

licenses based upon some reasonable metric or set of metrics including,
but not limited to, those items detailed in subsection (a), previous months'

commission; or
(C) Placing or modifying a limit on the total amount of production
by medical cannabis cultivation operation licensees in the state,
collectively, based upon some reasonable metric or set of metrics
determined by the commission, including, but not limited to, those items

(B) Attempt to reduce the illegal market for medical cannabis.
SECTION 23.

manufacturer operated by the licensee. This part does not require such operations to be
contiguous.
(b) A medical cannabis cultivation operation shall track all medical cannabis the
operation cultivates from seed or immature plant to wholesale transfer or destruction.
SECTION 24.
(a) A medical cannabis-infused product must be manufactured with equipment
used exclusively for the manufacture and preparation of medical cannabis-infused

infused products manufacturer does not disclose to the consumer that the final
medical cannabis-infused product contains a trademarked food product;
- 45 - 001239

manner that would cause a reasonable consumer confusion as to whether the
medical cannabis-infused product was a trademarked food product; and
(3) Label or package a medical cannabis-infused product in a manner
that violates any federal trademark law or regulation.
SECTION 25. A person who has any financial interest in a medical cannabis testing
facility shall not hold any license or have any financial interest in another type of medical
cannabis establishment.
SECTION 26. Notwithstanding another law to the contrary, electronic payment and filing
requirements for taxes levied under this part and title 67 are waived and a medical cannabis
establishment may file a return in paper form and remit payments in cash or other form
approved by the department of revenue. The commissioner of revenue may require that a
paper filing be accompanied by a manual handling fee, not to exceed twenty-five dollars
($25.00), that is reasonably calculated by the department to account for the additional cost of
preparing, printing, receiving, reviewing, and processing a paper filing.

SECTION 28. If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance
is held invalid, then the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the act that
can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the provisions of
this act are severable.
SECTION 29. For purposes of promulgating rules and forms, this act takes effect upon
becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it. For all other purposes, this act takes effect July
1, 2025, the public welfare requiring it.
