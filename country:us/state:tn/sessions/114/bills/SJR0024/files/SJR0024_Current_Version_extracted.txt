Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 24
By Massey
A RESOLUTION to recognize and commend the Tennessee
Federation of Republican Women on the
occasion of the organization's seventieth
anniversary.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly specially recognize
those estimable individuals who work to improve the quality of life for their fellow citizens
through their involvement in the political process; and
WHEREAS, one such meritorious group is the Tennessee Federation of Republican
Women (TNFRW), a laudable organization that is celebrating its seventieth anniversary this
year, marking seven decades of devoted service to the Republican Party and the citizens of the
Volunteer State; and
WHEREAS, the TNFRW was chartered as a state organization of the National
Federation of Republican Women in 1955; the state-level clubs of the Federation have long laid
the groundwork for organizing and electing Republicans; and
WHEREAS, the TNFRW was initially led by Alice Elder, the first president of the
Tennessee Federation; prior to Tennessee becoming affiliated with the National Federation, she
had organized women's groups in her own district and across the State; and
WHEREAS, currently under the capable leadership of President Sharon Boreing of
Johnson City, the TNFRW learned on December 7, 2024, that the Tennessee Republican Party
State Executive Committee had affirmed TNFRW's president as a voting member of the
Administrative Committee and granted Club presidents across the State a vote on County
Executive Committees; and

Republican Party State Executive Committee to strengthening the Republican Party's
infrastructure and advancing its mission in Tennessee; and

importance of collaboration between the Federation and Republican leadership; and
WHEREAS, to recognize the organization's seventieth anniversary, members of the
TNFRW are gathering for Ladies Day on the Hill on April 14, 2025; and
WHEREAS, an engaged, civic-minded group of women, the Tennessee Federation of
Republican Women is an organization that strives toward bettering the lives of the citizens of
this State and has successfully done so for seven decades; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we recognize and commend the Tennessee
Federation of Republican Women on the occasion of the organization's seventieth anniversary,
