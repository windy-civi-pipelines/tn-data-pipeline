SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 401
By Haile
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of David Roy Baldwin.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of David Roy Baldwin, a
painter, craftsman, religious leader, humble servant of God, and faithful friend; and
WHEREAS, born in Libertyville, Illinois, on October 6, 1953, to Roy Genus Baldwin and
Genevieve Visina Baldwin, David Baldwin was a skilled artist whose unique talent and
perspective allowed him to work professionally in the field, and in whatever endeavor he chose
to pursue, he carried it out with his characteristic precision and poise; and
WHEREAS, preeminently defined by his life of prayer and service to God, Mr. Baldwin
was a passionate disciple of Christ who dedicated his life to ministering to those in prisons and
nursing homes after his ordination at Regeneration Nations; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Baldwin was a prominent figure in local politics, chairing the Republican
Party in Trousdale County for twelve years and serving on the Trousdale County Election
Commission, and through his continuous efforts, he helped to flip the county to the Grand Ole
Party for the first time, consequently introducing meaningful change in legislation and election
integrity; and
WHEREAS, apart from his work in realms sacred and civic, he was a devoted babysitter
of his grandchildren, a disaster relief volunteer, and an event coordinator, roles that witnessed
both his expansive competency and his ever-present compassion; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Baldwin enjoyed the refined leisure of outdoorsmanship, whether he
was hunting or fishing, and his special bond with his German Shepherd, Sarge, was a profound
treasure; and
