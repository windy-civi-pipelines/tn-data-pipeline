SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 332
By Yarbro
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Hillsboro Burros
boys' basketball team upon winning the 2025
TSSAA Division I, Class 4A state championship.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lads is the Burros boys' basketball team of
Hillsboro High School, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of
competitors and truly worthy of admiration by winning the 2025 TSSAA Division I, Class 4A
state championship, the first such state championship in school history and the first by a Metro
Nashville large class school since 1981; and
WHEREAS, entering regional competition as District 11 champions, Hillsboro quickly
cleared the decks by crushing Green Hill 69-38 in the quarterfinals, thumping Cane Ridge 67-41
in their semifinal match-up, and cruising past Beech 51-38 in the final to win the Region 6
championship; and
WHEREAS, the Burros then crushed Centennial 51-23 in the sectional round to punch
their ticket for the Big Dance; and
WHEREAS, poised for ultimate victory in the Class 4A state tournament at MTSU's
Murphy Center, Hillsboro bested Maryville 53-47 in the quarterfinals and defeated Bradley
Central 63-48 in the semifinal round to advance to the final; and
WHEREAS, appearing in their first state title game since 1956, the Burros prevailed over
Oak Ridge by a score of 57-42 to claim the Gold Ball trophy that signifies a state champion and
finish the 2024-2025 campaign with an outstanding 34-5 record; and

young men not only made possible a championship but also surely bode well for their future
success; and
