HOUSE RESOLUTION 7
By Pearson
A RESOLUTION to designate September 22 as "Veterans Suicide
Prevention Day" in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, suicide is a major public health issue and among the top ten causes of
death in the United States; unfortunately, for more than a decade, the suicide rate has been
rising in the general U.S. population and especially among veterans, the very men and women
who risked their lives for their country; and
WHEREAS, in its 2018-2024 strategic plan, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) identified preventing veteran suicide as its highest clinical priority; and
WHEREAS, there were 6,407 veteran suicide deaths in the United States in 2022, an
average of 17.6 veteran suicide deaths per day; and
WHEREAS, in 2022, suicide was the twelfth leading cause of death for veterans, the
fourth leading cause of veterans' years of potential life lost, and the second leading cause of
death for veterans under forty-five years of age; and
WHEREAS, the suicide rate among male veterans was higher in 2022 than in all the
years between 2001-2022; and
WHEREAS, in 2022, there were 184 veteran suicide deaths in Tennessee, an average
of 41.3 such deaths per 100,000 population; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee's veterans suicide rate exceeds those of the Southern Region
and the U.S. and is significantly higher than the general suicide rates for the State, Southern
Region, and the U.S.; and
WHEREAS, screening veterans for suicide risk in mental health, emergency, and
primary care settings can detect those veterans who might be thinking about harming

themselves, discern their current level of risk, and provide opportunities to offer appropriate
care, ultimately reducing suicide attempts; and
WHEREAS, as part of its National Strategy for Preventing Veteran Suicide, VA
developed Risk ID, a three-stage suicide screening process that has been implemented
successfully in VA settings; and
WHEREAS, caring contacts, which are brief, personal, nondemanding follow-up
messages sent to veterans after they receive care, have been linked to decreased suicide
attempts; and
WHEREAS, VA is expanding its Caring Contacts program based on this promising
evidence that such contacts can save lives; and
WHEREAS, efforts to promote community-based approaches to suicide prevention have
been launched by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) through its community prevention
framework, which includes seven components, ranging from providing economic support to
promoting connectedness, that help to create a protective environment; and
WHEREAS, VA has partnered with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration and communities across America to create and implement suicide prevention
plans targeting service members, veterans, and their families at the State and local levels; and
WHEREAS, additional research on this important topic is needed, as are additional
programs to provide support for and prevent suicide among veterans, our most distinguished
citizens who sacrificed their freedom and risked their lives in service of their fellow Americans;
and
WHEREAS, National Suicide Prevention Month is observed annually in September; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that in appreciation
