HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 235
By Faison
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Grassy Fork Lady
Ravens girls' basketball team upon winning the
Cocke County Elementary Basketball
Tournament.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Grassy Fork Lady Ravens girls'
basketball team, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of competitors and
truly worthy of admiration by winning the Cocke County Elementary Basketball Tournament
back-to-back (2024 and 2025) for the first time in school history; and
WHEREAS, in the championship game of the 2025 tournament, the Lady Ravens
trounced Edgemont by a score of 48-22 to bring home the gold; and
WHEREAS, after claiming the regular season championship in the small school division
and then winning their second consecutive Cocke County Elementary Basketball Tournament,
the Lady Ravens will nevermore be underrated or unappreciated by basketball experts; and
WHEREAS, the Lady Ravens' superb performance would not have been possible
without the stellar leadership of Coach James Groat, who was named Coach of the Year; and
WHEREAS, Bella Stanton, Stella Raines, and Ripley Groat of Grassy Fork were named
to the All-Tournament team; and
WHEREAS, Grassy Fork also won the Sportsmanship Award; and
WHEREAS, the Lady Ravens received the unfailing support of their families, their fans,
and their community, and their 2025 championship season brought joy, hope, and solace to a
Hartford community that had suffered major flood damage in September 2024; and

success; and
