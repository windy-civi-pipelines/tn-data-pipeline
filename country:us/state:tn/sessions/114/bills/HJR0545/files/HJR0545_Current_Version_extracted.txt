Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 545
By Cochran
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Karina Bystry of
Central High School of McMinn County upon
being named TSSAA Class 2A Miss Basketball.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should recognize
those incredibly successful student athletes who have distinguished themselves as inspirational
leaders among their peers; and
WHEREAS, a statewide committee of sportswriters recently selected Karina Bystry of
Central High School of McMinn County (CHSMC) as TSSAA Class 2A Miss Basketball based
upon her outstanding performance on the hardwood during the 2024-2025 season; and
WHEREAS, her superior academic record and upstanding character were also taken
into consideration when the committee selected Ms. Bystry to receive this prestigious award,
which honors the best Class 2A female basketball player in the entire State; and
WHEREAS, Karina Bystry is the all-time leading scorer in CHSMC history, having
completed her Chargerette career with 2,689 points and 842 rebounds; and
WHEREAS, Karina Bystry scored 964 points during the 2024-2025 season alone, a
milestone that ranks second in TSSAA history for five-on-five girls' basketball; and
WHEREAS, Karina Bystry received All-District honors four times and All-Region laurels
four times and was an All-State selection three times; and
WHEREAS, perhaps the most impressive achievement among the many to which she
can lay claim is the fact that Karina Bystry and her teammates compiled an incredible 119-20
record during her four-year career at CHSMC; and
