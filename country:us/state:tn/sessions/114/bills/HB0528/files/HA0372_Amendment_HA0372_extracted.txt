NOTICE IF YOU USE A PROFESSIONAL BONDSMAN:
Amount of Charges to You. If you are a Tennessee resident, the premium fee for your
bond should be ten percent (10%) of the face amount of your bond. For example, if your
bond is $2,500, then the premium on the bond should not be more or less than $250. If
you are not a Tennessee resident, then the amount of the bond should not be more than
fifteen percent (15%) or less than ten percent (10%) of the face amount of your bond.
For example, if your bond is $2,500, then the premium on the bond should not be more
than $375 or less than $250. In addition to this amount, the law also permits a one-time
$25 initiation fee (T.C.A. § 40-11-316) and the professional bondsman may collect a $12
bail tax (T.C.A. § 67-4-806).
Insist on a Receipt. The law (T.C.A. § 40-11-304) requires a bail bondsman to keep a
duplicate receipt. The receipt must show the name of the person paying money or

for which it is received, and the suit, action, or matter in which the money is paid.
Collateral That Can Be Required. If a bondsman insists on collateral in addition to the
premium fee, then you may wish to talk to another bondsman. However, a bondsman
may accept collateral, and if the bondsman accepts collateral, then the bondsman must
give you a written receipt for the collateral, and the receipt shall give in detail a full
description of the collateral received and the terms of redemption as required by T.C.A.
