HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 364
By Mitchell
A RESOLUTION to honor TailGate Brewery on the occasion of its
tenth anniversary in Nashville.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly are pleased to recognize a local
Tennessee business that has grown leaps and bounds to earn distinction as one of the best
craft beer breweries in the nation; and
WHEREAS, in February 2025, TailGate Brewery celebrated its tenth anniversary in
Nashville, after owner Wes Keegan relocated his company from San Diego, California, in the fall
of 2014; and
WHEREAS, the seven-acre TailGate Brewery headquarters opened in West Nashville in
February 2015, and the rest, as they say, is history; and
WHEREAS, from the humble beginnings of a one-man operation with no outside
investors, TailGate Brewery has grown to include 250 team members and nine breweries in
Tennessee, and the original location now features a fifty-barrel brewing system that produces
more than 300 recipes per year; and
WHEREAS, the second TailGate location opened on Music Row in 2016, followed by
new locations in East Nashville in 2018, Nashville International Airport in 2021, Germantown,
Hendersonville, and Chattanooga in 2022, South Nashville in 2023, and Murfreesboro in 2024;
and
WHEREAS, these nine breweries have three essential elements in common: cold,
creative beer, delicious pizza, and friendly customer service; and
WHEREAS, although he has attained great success in the past ten years, Mr. Keegan
remains committed to his mission of owning and operating the best craft beer brewery in
Tennessee; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Keegan's business model centers on people, and he wisely credits his
employees as key players in TailGate's growth and overall success; and
WHEREAS, TailGate has been able to hire and retain employees in a tight labor market
because of the company's ongoing investment in its team members; and
WHEREAS, in July 2022, TailGate began paying 100 percent of health-care benefits for
every one of its employees, thus achieving a longtime goal; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Keegan was inspired to offer this rare industry benefit to his employees
by the example of his late father, who died too young, in large part because he did not have
access to health care; and
WHEREAS, an icon in Nashville for ten years, TailGate Brewery is deserving of our
recognition as a bastion of great beer and even better company; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor owner Wes Keegan and the management and employees of
TailGate Brewery on the occasion of the brewery's tenth anniversary in Nashville and
congratulate them on growing their business to include nine locations in Tennessee.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
