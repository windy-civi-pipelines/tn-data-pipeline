HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 83
By Chism
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of William J. Chism, Sr.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of William J. Chism, Sr., a
beloved gentleman and family patriarch whose legacy of integrity, hard work, and spiritual
commitment will continue to inspire others; and
WHEREAS, born on July 16, 1944, in Hubert, Arkansas, William Chism was the first
child born to Ray and Dorothy Chism; he professed his hope in Christ and was baptized at New
Salem Church in West Memphis, Arkansas, where his father and uncle, James "Buddy" Chism,
served as deacons; and
WHEREAS, a standout football player at Melrose High School, Mr. Chism was awarded
the prestigious title of "The Gridiron Greatest," which recognized him as the top football player in
Memphis, and local radio station WDIA honored his athletic prowess with a gold watch; and
WHEREAS, William Chism served his country as a member of the United States Army,
and he worked at Armor Meat Packing before joining his three brothers, who had ventured into
the retail grocery business, a fortuitous endeavor that resulted in several stores operating under
the moniker "Chism Trail"; and
WHEREAS, together, the Chism brothers built the largest Black-owned supermarket
chain in Tennessee history; in addition to their retail success, they served as the building
contractors for many of the commercial buildings where they operated, solidifying their influence
in Memphis; and
WHEREAS, under the Chism Trail flagship, the family business employed hundreds of
individuals in the community, as many as 300 people at its peak, cultivating a culture of

entrepreneurship and business acumen and empowering future generations to pursue their own
paths to success; and
WHEREAS, William Chism was also a lover of the outdoors and a true cowboy at heart,
earning him the nickname "Wild Bill"; he owned and rode horses, built a barn in the backyard of
his Memphis home in Lakeview Gardens, and bought a farm where he and his sons spent time
connecting with nature; and
WHEREAS, a man of abiding faith throughout his lifetime, Mr. Chism served as a
deacon at Mt. Bethel Church, sang background with his father in the Magnolia Specials, and
attended Mt. Vernon Baptist Church with his wife in later years; and
WHEREAS, he was also wholly devoted to his family and was revered as the Chism
family patriarch, leading by example through wisdom, accountability, strength, and purpose and
inspiring his progeny to greatness; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Chism is survived by his wife of forty-seven years, Norma; children,
Angela, William, Jr., Stephanie, Jesse, Justin, and Jerome; thirteen grandchildren; four great-
grandchildren; ten siblings; and a host of nieces and nephews; and
WHEREAS, throughout his many endeavors in both public and private life, William
Chism distinguished himself as a devoted family man who served his community in myriad
ways; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should pay tribute to his bountiful life of purpose and
commitment; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of William J. Chism, Sr., reflecting fondly upon his
enduring legacy in Memphis and beyond.
