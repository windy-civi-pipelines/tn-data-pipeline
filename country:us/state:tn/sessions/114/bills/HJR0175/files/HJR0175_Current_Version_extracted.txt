A RESOLUTION relative to free speech and civil discourse on
Tennessee's university and college campuses.
WHEREAS, America must remain the world's leader in educational advancement and
opportunity as well as research greatness; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee universities play an important role in advancing America's
greatness through the development of our country's future leaders and the conduct of
substantive research for the country's interests; and
WHEREAS, our State has a strong and rich history of research capabilities ranging from
the University of Tennessee system, Vanderbilt University, Tennessee Technological University,
Austin Peay University, the University of Memphis, and Middle Tennessee State University to
several HBCUs and independent universities and colleges; and
WHEREAS, the role of colleges and universities, both private and public, in partnering
with government officials in the advancement of national security, civic development and
planning, and other essential quality-of-life issues is vital to our country's interests; and
WHEREAS, after October 7, 2023, when Israel was brutally violated in a terrorist attack,
several universities allowed disruptive actions that threatened some students' security and
stifled free speech and civil discourse in a manner that was disrespectful to the exchange and
hearing of diverse opinions in a safe area; and
WHEREAS, these disruptive events continued on numerous campuses across the
country and created a lack of confidence among the American people about the role of
American universities in the continued greatness of America; and
