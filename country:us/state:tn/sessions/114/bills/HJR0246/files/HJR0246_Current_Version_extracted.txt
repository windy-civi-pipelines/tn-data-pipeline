Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 246
By Hardaway
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Reverend Dr. Walter
Womack.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of Reverend Walter
Womack of Memphis, a religious and civil rights leader, inspiring pastor, humble servant of God,
and faithful friend; and
WHEREAS, beginning his work as a laborer in God's harvest in 1997, Reverend
Womack began his first pastoral work in 1999 as an associate pastor under the direction of the
late Pastor Paul F. Coleman at Soul Winners Baptist Church; and
WHEREAS, Reverend Womack then served as pastor at Faithful Baptist Church for
approximately twenty-five years, laying a cornerstone that will be built upon for years to come,
and in the ultimate testament to his generous selflessness as a shepherd, he tragically passed
while consoling one of his congregants before a surgery; and
WHEREAS, he was known as a man of God and led his people, both longtime
congregants and those who have newly entered into the fold, to discover the graces in this
pilgrimage, and he confirmed and comforted his people in faith, whether marking the new
beginnings of marriages or commemorating at funerals those who have fallen asleep; and
WHEREAS, Reverend Womack always did his utmost to foster his capacity for greater
ministry, and he pursued additional studies at the Collierville School of Religion, Tennessee
School of Religion, and Missionary Baptist Seminary, and he received certification to teach
through the Pastor's Alternative Initiative and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
where he also served as the president of the Memphis local chapter; and
WHEREAS, his positive spiritual influence spread far beyond the walls of Faithful Baptist
Church with his appointment as the National Social Justice Committee chairman within the
HJR0246
003859
- 1 -
National Baptist Convention, a position that served a four-state area, and through his over thirty-
year membership with the Memphis Baptist Ministerial Association; and
WHEREAS, the state of our country's youth was a cause particularly dear to Reverend
Womack's heart, and he set himself to advocate for their welfare with the American Federation
for Children; and
WHEREAS, a consummate community servant, Reverend Womack always pushed for
programs to help the disadvantaged and misfortunate of Memphis, establishing ministries for
the unhoused, imprisoned, and young, and his leadership in clothing and food pantry drives,
daily food pantries, back-to-school drives, blanket drives, health fairs, Big Brother mentorship
programs, and job training programs have surely helped hundreds, if not thousands, of
Memphians to see the love of God in their neighbor; and
WHEREAS, not unfamiliar with the daily toils of his flock, Reverend Womack also
worked as a self-employed contractor with his own business, Womack's Painting and Tile, for
over twenty-five years; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his good work from the pulpit and beyond, Reverend Womack
was wholly devoted to his family and friends, especially his beloved wife of over twenty-five
years, Deborah, and their four children; and
WHEREAS, Reverend Womack served his faith and his community with distinction for
more than a quarter of a century, and he should be remembered for his many contributions and
the example he set for others; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of Reverend Dr. Walter Womack, reflecting fondly
upon his resolute service to God and humanity, and extend our sympathy and condolences to
his family and many friends.
- 2 - 003859
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
