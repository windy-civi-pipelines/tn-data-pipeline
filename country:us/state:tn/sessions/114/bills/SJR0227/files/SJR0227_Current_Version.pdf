SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 227
By McNally
A RESOLUTION to recognize and honor St. Mary's School on the
occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should recognize
those exemplary educational institutions that have made significant contributions, through an
abiding commitment to excellence, to their respective communities and to this State; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy institution is St. Mary's School of Oak Ridge, which is
celebrating its seventy-fifth anniversary of operation this year; and
WHEREAS, the story of St. Mary's is intertwined with that of St. Mary Parish; when the
U.S. government situated its major wartime project in the East Tennessee mountains in the
1940s and Oak Ridge, "the Secret City," was born, hundreds of workers and scientists flocked
to the area to staff the city's several large nuclear plants; and
WHEREAS, the initial inhabitants of Oak Ridge came from diverse backgrounds,
cultures, traditions, and locations, and many of them were Catholic, which necessitated the
establishment of a parish and, subsequently, a school for the children of the residents; and
WHEREAS, St. Mary Parish and St. Mary's School shared a vital role in the
development and direction of their community; in 1949 and 1950, the parcel of land upon which
the parish and school now sit was purchased, and on September 10, 1950, St. Mary's School
opened its doors to 200 students; and
WHEREAS, originally home to grades one through six, grades seven and eight were
added in the school's second year of operation, and kindergarten began in the 1983-1984
academic year; and

WHEREAS, the pre-kindergarten program started in the fall of 1985, and the school
reached its current completement of grades with the addition of a pre-school, three-year-old
program in 2017; and
WHEREAS, improvements to St. Mary's School over the years include the addition of a
primary science lab and complete primary science curriculum for grades pre-K through five in
1999; the lab is the only one of its kind in the area and is still one of the few in the entire State.
A total physical renovation of the school, to include a new gymnasium, was completed in
September 2000; and
WHEREAS, in 2010, St. Mary's School was declared a Blue Ribbon School of
Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education, placing it in the top ten percent of schools in
the nation academically; and
WHEREAS, from its inception, the school was staffed by the Dominican Sisters of St.
Cecilia from Nashville, a tradition that continues to this day; and
WHEREAS, St. Mary's School has long enjoyed the teaching services of educators of
the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity and a staff committed to the highest ideals of public
service and quality education for all; and
WHEREAS, the dedication to academic excellence demonstrated by all the fine
individuals affiliated with St. Mary's School is clearly deserving of our respect, admiration, and
commendation on this most auspicious occasion; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor St. Mary's School of Oak Ridge on the
occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary, commend its administration, faculty, staff, and
students, both past and present, for their dedication to the highest tenets of education, and
extend to them our best wishes for much continued success.
