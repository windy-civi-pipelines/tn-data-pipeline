A RESOLUTION to honor Jared Curtis, outstanding quarterback
for the Nashville Christian School state-
champion football team.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly take great pleasure in recognizing a
young man who, having already achieved great success in high school football, will most
certainly continue to shine on the gridiron as a senior and excel in all aspects of life during a
bright future; and
WHEREAS, Jared Curtis, junior quarterback for state-champion Nashville Christian
School (NCS), is a five-star college prospect who is nationally ranked as the number-one
quarterback for the 2026 class, the number-four player overall, and the number-one player
overall in Tennessee by 247Sports Composite and is ranked as the number-one player in the
nation for the class of 2026 by other national recruiting services; and
WHEREAS, Jared Curtis received the 2024 Tennessee Titans Mr. Football Award, the
Gatorade Tennessee Player of the Year Award, the 615Preps Player of the Year Award, and
the MaxPreps Tennessee Player of the Year Award and was named a MaxPreps Junior All-
American in recognition of his awe-inspiring performance as both a passer and a rusher; and
WHEREAS, although these accolades are much-deserved, Jared Curtis is quite self-
effacing about his accomplishments, and he plays not for the fame but for his teammates, his
coaches, his school, and for the love of the game; and
WHEREAS, during the 2024 season, Jared completed 70 percent of his passes for
2,830 yards and passed for 40 touchdowns; he also rushed for 637 yards and 18 touchdowns,
compiling 3,647 total yards; and
