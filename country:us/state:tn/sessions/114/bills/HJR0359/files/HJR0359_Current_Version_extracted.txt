HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 359
By Russell
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Sergeant Cody Manders
of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
own concerns to ensure our collective freedom and personal safety; in providing for the
domestic tranquility of the community as a whole, society recognizes the need for a system of
laws; and
WHEREAS, the enforcement of the law has been entrusted to a small number of
dedicated individuals who face daily the rigors of human conflict in protecting those whom they
so selflessly serve; and
WHEREAS, the people of Tennessee are fortunate to be served by the brave and
dedicated law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line while carrying out their
essential duties; and
WHEREAS, Sergeant Cody Manders of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office is one such
outstanding and heroic public servant, who quickly responded in the early morning hours of
August 2, 2024, when the Monroe County Justice Center became the target of an attack by an
active shooter; and
WHEREAS, on that day, a male exited his vehicle and began firing at the Justice Center,
placing countless lives in danger; when the attacker started to enter the Justice Center, deputies
worked together to get citizens to safety, while neutralizing the threat; and
WHEREAS, Sergeant Cody Manders placed himself directly in harm's way and
performed his role as a law enforcement officer to his highest ability, nearly sacrificing himself to
save others; and
WHEREAS, Sergeant Manders exhibits integrity, probity, and valor in his public life as a
law enforcement officer, compassion and loyalty in private life, and dedication in all his chosen
endeavors; and
