WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Lady Chargers girls' basketball
team of Westview High School, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of
competitors and truly worthy of admiration by winning their third TSSAA Division I, Class 2A
state championship in four years, having previously won it all in 2022 and 2023; and
WHEREAS, in post-season play, the Lady Chargers demolished Madison Magnet 77-21,
trounced Adamsville 80-49, and rolled over Gibson County 66-42 to claim the Region 7-2A title;
and
WHEREAS, Westview then proceeded to crush Trezevant 77-32 in the sectional round
to gain entry into the promised land of the state tournament; and
WHEREAS, playing in the Class 2A state tournament at MTSU's Murphy Center, the
Lady Chargers easily defeated East Nashville 48-30 in the quarterfinals and then crushed
Loretto 64-39 in their semifinal match-up to advance to the final; and
WHEREAS, facing York Institute in the title game, Westview prevailed 44-38 in a close
contest to win the Gold Ball trophy that signifies a state champion, finishing the season with a
nearly perfect 33-1 record; and
WHEREAS, each of these young ladies holds Martin's small-town traditions close to her
heart and is proud to be a Lady Charger; the team members include Mary "Maddie" Gray,
