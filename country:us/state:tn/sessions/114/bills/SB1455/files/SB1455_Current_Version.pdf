BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. Chapter 55 of the Private Acts of 1993, as amended by Chapter 134 of the
Private Acts of 1998, and any other acts amendatory thereto, is amended in Section 1 of Article
III by deleting the Section in its entirety and substituting instead the following:
SECTION 1. Officers to be elected. Terms of office. Term Limits. There shall
be elected by the qualified voters of the City of Bartlett, a Mayor and six (6) Aldermen in
non-partisan, at-large, general municipal elections held in November. The Mayor and
Aldermen shall be elected for terms of four (4) years, and each shall hold his or her
office until his or her successor is elected and qualified. The office of Mayor is limited to
three (3) four-year terms, or a total of twelve (12) years served; and the office of
Alderman is limited to three (3) four-year terms, or a total of twelve (12) years served.
Serving part of a term as Mayor or Alderman due to assumption, appointment, or
election for less than the full four-year term shall not count toward the three-term limit for
that office. The term limits provided in this section shall apply to each office as it comes
up for election following the effective date of the amendment enacting these term limits.
Upon the effective date of that amendment, the term limits shall not apply to disqualify
any incumbent member of the Board of Mayor and Aldermen from completing his or her
current term of office. It is the intent of this Charter to designate the existing six (6)
Aldermanic positions one (1) through six (6). In filing for election, any candidate for
Alderman or Mayor shall select and identify the position sought. The Mayor and all
Aldermen shall be elected from the City-at-Large and one (1) Alderman shall be elected
