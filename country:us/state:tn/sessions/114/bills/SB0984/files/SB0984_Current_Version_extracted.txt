COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THIS FORM
What does the Transfer on Death (TOD) deed do? When you die, this deed
transfers the described property, subject to any liens or mortgages (or other
encumbrances) on the property at your death. Probate is not required. The TOD deed
has no effect until you die. You can revoke it at any time. You are also free to transfer
the property to someone else during your lifetime. If you do not own any interest in the
property when you die, this deed will have no effect.
How do I make a TOD deed? Complete this form. Have it acknowledged before
a notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments. Record
the form in each county where any part of the property is located. The form has no
effect unless it is acknowledged and recorded before your death.
Is the "legal description" of the property necessary? Yes.
How do I find the "legal description" of the property? This information may be on
the deed you received when you became an owner of the property. This information
may also be available in the office of the register of deeds for the county where the
property is located. If you are not absolutely sure, consult a lawyer.
Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed? Yes. If you have not yet
recorded the deed and want to change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy
the deed.
How do I "record" the TOD deed? Take the completed and acknowledged form
to the office of the register of deeds of the county where the property is located. Follow
the instructions given by the register of deeds to make the form part of the official
- 12 - 000497
property records. If the property is in more than one county, you need to record the
deed in each county.
Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind? Yes. You can revoke the
TOD deed. No one, including the beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.
How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded? There are three ways to
revoke a recorded TOD deed: (1) Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and
record it in each county where the property is located; (2) Complete and acknowledge a
new TOD deed that disposes of the same property, and record it in each county where
the property is located; or (3) Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime
by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You may not revoke the TOD
deed by will.
I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I do? Do not complete
this form under pressure. Seek help from a trusted family member, friend, or lawyer.
Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed? No, but it is
recommended. Secrecy can cause later complications and might make it easier for

to fit some but not all situations. If you have other questions, you are encouraged to
consult a lawyer.

COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THIS FORM
What does the Transfer on Death (TOD) deed do? When you die, this deed
transfers the described property, subject to any liens or mortgages (or other
encumbrances) on the property at your death. Probate is not required. The TOD deed
has no effect until you die. You can revoke it at any time. You are also free to transfer
the property to someone else during your lifetime. If you do not own any interest in the
property when you die, this deed will have no effect.
How do I make a TOD deed? Complete this form. Have it acknowledged before
a notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments. Record
the form in each county where any part of the property is located. The form has no
effect unless it is acknowledged and recorded before your death.
Is the "legal description" of the property necessary? Yes.
How do I find the "legal description" of the property? This information may be on
the deed you received when you became an owner of the property. This information
may also be available in the office of the register of deeds for the county where the
property is located. If you are not absolutely sure, consult a lawyer.
Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed? Yes. If you have not yet
recorded the deed and want to change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy
the deed.
How do I "record" the TOD deed? Take the completed and acknowledged form
to the office of the register of deeds of the county where the property is located. Follow
the instructions given by the register of deeds to make the form part of the official
- 12 - 000497

property records. If the property is in more than one county, you need to record the
deed in each county.
Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind? Yes. You can revoke the
TOD deed. No one, including the beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.
How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded? There are three ways to
revoke a recorded TOD deed: (1) Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and
record it in each county where the property is located; (2) Complete and acknowledge a
new TOD deed that disposes of the same property, and record it in each county where
the property is located; or (3) Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime
by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You may not revoke the TOD
deed by will.
I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I do? Do not complete
this form under pressure. Seek help from a trusted family member, friend, or lawyer.
Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed? No, but it is
recommended. Secrecy can cause later complications and might make it easier for
others to commit fraud.

to fit some but not all situations. If you have other questions, you are encouraged to
consult a lawyer.

(2) When a motor vehicle is jointly owned by two (2) or more persons, the

the title is "or."
(3) A transfer on death certificate of title must include after the name of
the owner, or owners, the words "transfer on death to" or the abbreviation "TOD"

consent of a beneficiary with the filing of an application for a subsequent transfer

Upon issuance of any subsequent certificate of title pursuant to this subsection
(e), the previous certificate that was issued is void.

deleting "destroyed certificate," and substituting "destroyed certificate or a subsequent transfer
on death certificate of title pursuant to § 55-3-118(e),".
SECTION 5. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 66-24-101(a)(12), is amended by
adding ", including transfer on death deeds" immediately after "description".

constitute a part of the law enacted by this act. However, the Tennessee Code Commission is
requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act.
