SENATE BILL 1372
By Watson
HOUSE BILL 651
By Williams
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 56
and Title 71, relative to health care.
WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds that since 2012 TennCare payments to
healthcare providers generally reimburse twenty-eight percent through thirty-four percent less
than Medicare; and
WHEREAS, the General Assembly requires TennCare to incentivize better access to
quality health care in rural and underserved communities; and
WHEREAS, recent federal regulations allow states to increase Medicaid payments for
many services to up to the average commercial rate to enable Medicaid plans to compete with
commercial plans when building provider networks; and
WHEREAS, it is prudent that, within the next twelve months, the Bureau of TennCare
develop a plan that identifies a variety of approaches, including increasing payment rates for
healthcare providers to parity with average commercial contracting rates, improving outreach
and problem resolution to providers, reducing barriers to provider credentialing and contracting,
providing for improved or expanded use of telehealth, and improving the timeliness and
accuracy of processes such as claim payment and prior authorization, and submit the plan to
the General Assembly for consideration during the following legislative session; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
