SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 18
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Tom
Lee's heroism.
WHEREAS, on May 8, 1925, the M.E. Norman set sail from Memphis with seventy-two
men, women, and children onboard; and
WHEREAS, the trip to Pinckney Landing, two miles downriver of Memphis, passed
without incident; however, the boat ran into trouble on the return trip when the steamer capsized
and its passengers were tossed into the Mississippi River; and
WHEREAS, Tom Lee, who was passing by the scene, courageously rescued thirty-two
of the passengers from the Mississippi River, despite his not being able to swim; and
WHEREAS, Tom Lee was duly recognized for his heroic act and awarded a job as a
sanitation worker; the Engineers Club purchased his home in Memphis, and he was celebrated
at the White House by President Calvin Coolidge; and
WHEREAS, Astor Park in Memphis was renamed Tom Lee Park in 1954, and in 1991,
the park was expanded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and
WHEREAS, a century ago, Tom Lee heroically answered the call of duty amid the frigid
waters of the Mississippi River, sacrificing his own well-being and saving the lives of thirty-two of
his fellow citizens; and
WHEREAS, we should never allow Tennesseans such as Tom Lee and their
courageous deeds to be forgotten for their actions speak loudly and persuasively about the
inner fortitude, virtue, and selflessness of human beings in times of emergency and remind us
that heroes will always walk among us, no matter where or when we live; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
SJR0018
