Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 318
By Campbell
A RESOLUTION to designate March 13 as "Father Charles
Strobel Day".
WHEREAS, Father Charles Frederick Strobel was a Nashville native, grew up in the
Germantown neighborhood, and fostered deep connections within the community and churches
in the area; and
WHEREAS, Father Strobel believed in living his faith on a daily basis, pulling inspiration
from the Sermon on the Mount, among other holy texts and divine inspirations; and
WHEREAS, upon becoming a priest, Father Strobel quickly and effectively set his sights
on bettering the lives of the homeless and impoverished by opening up a facility for homeless
people so they could have a warm place to stay at a time when endemic poverty and other
social concerns were impacting Tennessee and the nation as a whole; and
WHEREAS, Father Strobel founded the Room in the Inn, a sanctuary opened in a
church parking lot in the winter of 1985; and
WHEREAS, the Room in the Inn has since blossomed into a national model for assisting
the homeless, with over 200 congregations and 7,000 volunteers sheltering nearly 1,500
individuals from November 1 to March 31 of each season; and
WHEREAS, this State seeks to honor Father Strobel and how he combated
homelessness to enact positive change and created programs for the homeless that have
become a successful model for the entire nation; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that March 13 is designated as "Father Charles Strobel
Day" to honor his mission and the valiant and noble strides Father Charles Frederick Strobel
