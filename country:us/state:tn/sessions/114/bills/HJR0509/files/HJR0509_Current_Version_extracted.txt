HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 509
By Stevens
A RESOLUTION to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the
Battles of Lexington and Concord.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should commemorate
those historic events that shaped the foundation of our nation and honor the courage and
sacrifice of those who fought for the cause of American independence; and
WHEREAS, April 19, 2025, marks the 250th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and
Concord, which were fought on April 19, 1775, and signaled the beginning of the American
Revolutionary War; and
WHEREAS, these pivotal engagements, which followed the legendary midnight ride of
Paul Revere, saw the confrontation between colonial minutemen and British regulars and gave
rise to the immortal phrase, "the shot heard round the world"; and
WHEREAS, the minutemen, ordinary citizens trained and prepared to respond at a
moment's notice, stood with extraordinary courage and resolve in defense of their homes, their
rights, and the principles of self-government; and
WHEREAS, the courageous patriots who lost their lives at Lexington Green and on the
road to Concord paid the ultimate price in the earliest moments of a long and arduous struggle
for American independence; and
WHEREAS, their bravery and sacrifice helped ignite the flame of liberty that would
eventually give birth to the United States of America, inspiring generations of Americans in their
ongoing pursuit of freedom and justice; and
WHEREAS, we hold deep reverence for the legacy of the American Revolution and the
men and women whose actions forged the path to nationhood; now, therefore,
