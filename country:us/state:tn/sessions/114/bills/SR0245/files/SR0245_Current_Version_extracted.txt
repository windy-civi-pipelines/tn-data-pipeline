Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 245
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Kortland Whalum of
Memphis.
WHEREAS, Kortland Whalum is a powerful voice in American theater and soul music—a
dynamic vocalist, actor, and educator whose artistic journey reflects deep Memphis roots, family
legacy, and a lifelong commitment to storytelling through song. Known for his commanding
stage presence and emotionally resonant performances, Kortland has become a fixture in
Memphis's vibrant theatrical community while also emerging as a soul artist in his own right; and
WHEREAS, born into the legendary Whalum family, Kortland is the son of Rev. Kenneth
Whalum Jr., the current pastor of Olivet Fellowship, and nephew of Grammy-winning
saxophonist Kirk Whalum. Music was in the air from day one—his mother, Sheila, and
grandmother were singers; his brothers Kenneth and Kameron are both renowned musicians.
But rather than following the path of instrumental performance, Kortland found his voice—
literally—as a singer. Initially wanting to emulate his brother Kenneth on the saxophone, he
pivoted to vocal performance and discovered his calling; and
WHEREAS, his first performance at age six was in church—a setting that nurtured his
confidence and sense of purpose. Over time, that foundation of gospel music, spiritual
storytelling, and community shaped him into an emotionally intuitive performer. His trajectory
shifted when he attended Overton High School, where exposure to Broadway productions
during a trip to New York sparked a passion for theater. That passion followed him to
Morehouse College, where he studied voice and deepened his appreciation for acting and
performance; and

WHEREAS, Kortland's career blossomed in New York, but a role in Hattiloo Theatre's
The Wiz brought him back to Memphis—where he's remained ever since, becoming a beloved
figure in the city's performing arts scene. His standout performances in Cats, The Wiz, and
Raisin have garnered critical acclaim for their emotional depth and nuanced storytelling. Chris
Davis of the Memphis Flyer called his portrayal of Walter Lee Younger "as rich a performance
as I've seen in ages"; and
WHEREAS, beyond the stage, Kortland served for four years as a vocal instructor at the
Stax Music Academy, where he mentored students and led international performances. He
currently serves on the board of the Memphis Listening Lab, further cementing his role as a
community leader and cultural steward. In 2021, Kortland returned to his roots with A Love
Letter, a deeply personal neo-soul EP featuring musical contributions from his entire family,
including uncles and brothers. The title track—intimate, raw, and prayer-like—showcases
Kortland's ability to convey vulnerability with finesse; and
WHEREAS, for Kortland, music is both mirror and medicine. "It really has been my
therapy," he says. "I sing through happy times and through sad times. It's been like my twin
throughout my life." Now nearing forty, he embraces the freedom of his artistry, always seeking
the next opportunity to evolve, give back, and tell the stories that matter; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor the service of
Kortland Whalum, reflecting on his contributions to music and theater and his enduring legacy of
excellence and service.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.
