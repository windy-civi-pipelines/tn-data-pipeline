- 12 - 001969

beneficiary nominated by the member by written designation duly acknowledged and
filed with the board of trustees at the time of retirement; provided, that if the designated
beneficiary predeceases the retired member, then the retirement allowance payable to
the member after death of the designated beneficiary must be equal to the retirement
allowance that would have been payable had the member not elected an option.
SECTION 18. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 8-36-606, is amended by deleting
the section and substituting:
(a) A retired member who has not selected an optional retirement allowance

system.
(b) The election of a designated beneficiary under an optional retirement
allowance as provided in § 8-36-601(b) must not be canceled or changed by the retiree
after the retiree's effective date of retirement except as provided in subsections (c)-(f).
(c) After a retired member's effective date of retirement or such later time as may
be provided in rules adopted by the board of trustees, the retiree may cancel the retiree's
designated beneficiary because of the death of the beneficiary or the retiree's divorce
from the designated beneficiary, upon the written request of the retiree. If the retiree
designated multiple beneficiaries, then the portion of the benefit payment that was
payable to the cancelled beneficiary must not be distributed or redistributed to the
remaining beneficiaries. The retiree shall provide the retirement system with the
completed and signed written cancellation request accompanied by either of the
following, whichever is applicable:
(1) A copy of the marital dissolution agreement and final decree of
divorce or annulment to confirm that the cancellation is not in conflict with the

honored; or

retiree's death, the newly designated beneficiary is only entitled to the remaining
accumulated contributions in the retiree's account, if any, and to the last
retirement allowance payable in the month of the retiree's death. The retirement
allowance payable to the retired member after the cancellation of the designated
beneficiary pursuant to this section is not affected by the cancellation of the
beneficiary designation; or
(2) If the retiree selected only one (1) individual as the retiree's
beneficiary, designate the retiree's spouse as the member's sole, new
designated beneficiary, resulting in a reannuitization of the member's benefit.
(e) If the retiree elects to reannuitize pursuant to subdivision (d)(2), then the
retiree shall submit an application to reannuitize to the retirement system after the retired
member's marriage to the proposed new beneficiary, and provide the retirement system
with the marriage certificate demonstrating the marriage between the retiree and the
proposed new beneficiary.
(f) Upon receiving a completed application, the retirement system shall process
the reannuitization of the retiree's retirement benefit pursuant to the option selected by
the retiree on the retiree's effective date of retirement. The value of the new joint and
survivor annuity must be the actuarial equivalent of the retiree's benefit prospectively, in
- 14 - 001969

effect at the time the new annuity is elected. The benefit must be reduced based on the
ages of the retiree and the new beneficiary at the time of the change. The change in
beneficiary must become effective in the month following the month that the retirement
system approves the change in beneficiary.

Notwithstanding another law to the contrary, any person who becomes a part-time
