SENATE BILL 242
By Oliver
HOUSE BILL 298
By Behn
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 13;
Title 47 and Title 66, relative to housing market
manipulation.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. This act is known and may be cited as the "Homes not Hedge Funds Act."
SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 13, Chapter 3, is amended by adding
the following as a new part:
13-3-701.
The general assembly finds that:
(1) This state has experienced urban growth at levels significantly higher
than many states;
(2) It does not wish to inhibit the ownership of property but recognizes
that it is becoming increasingly common for business entities to purchase
substantial numbers of single-family homes for use as rental properties, both
lowering the supply of, and increasing the costs of, such homes;
(3) Home ownership is recognized as one (1) of the most reliable ways to
build wealth, permitting owners to build equity, which can serve as reserves in
times of need, and in terms of passive income and increases in market value of
owned property; and
(4) It is necessary to balance the interests of building wealth through the
use of business entities acquiring properties for rental purposes against the state,
local, and individual economic benefits that result from having a citizenry broadly
engaged in and accruing the advantages attendant to home ownership.
