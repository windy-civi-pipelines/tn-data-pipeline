HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 153
By Jones J
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Dr. Charles Kimbrough
for his outstanding community leadership.
WHEREAS, it is the pleasure of the members of this General Assembly to acknowledge
those venerable Tennesseans who were willing to sacrifice their personal safety to fight to
ensure the individual and collective freedom of oppressed groups across the nation; and
WHEREAS, one such distinguished individual is Dr. Charles Kimbrough, a civil rights
activist, former president of the Nashville branch of the NAACP, military veteran, retired
veterinarian, and minister; and
WHEREAS, born on June 24, 1927, in Prospect, Dr. Kimbrough grew up during the
height of the vicious and brutal Jim Crow South, relatively close to Pulaski, the birthplace of the
Ku Klux Klan. He learned early on from his family the value of hard work, perseverance, and
determination; and
WHEREAS, a veteran of the Korean War, Dr. Kimbrough traveled extensively while
enlisted in the armed forces and learned French while stationed in France. He earned a Purple
Heart, Medical Combat Award, and Bronze Star in 1950 for his bravery while serving; and
WHEREAS, following the conclusion of his military service, he used the GI Bill to attend
Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University, graduating in 1956 with honors and a
Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. Dr. Kimbrough went on to enroll in the Tuskegee
Institute, where he earned a Doctorate in Veterinary Medicine, becoming one of the first African
Americans to hold a license to practice veterinary medicine in the State of Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, as a member of the Civil Rights Movement in Tennessee, Dr. Kimbrough
introduced scores of African Americans to the NAACP and its mission to remove all barriers of
racial discrimination through democratic processes; and
