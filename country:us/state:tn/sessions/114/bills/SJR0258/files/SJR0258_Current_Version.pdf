SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 258
By Oliver
A RESOLUTION to recognize the Metro Nashville Public Schools
Visual and Performing Arts Team and its Emmy-
winning documentary Every Student Known:
The Creation of an Anthem.
WHEREAS, Tennessee is proud to be the home of various genres of music that are
essential components of the American musical landscape; from Bristol, the birthplace of country
music, to Memphis, the blues capital of the world, musicians across the State continue to inspire
and influence others with their astounding artistry; and
WHEREAS, recently, students from Metro Nashville Public Schools (MNPS) showcased
their dedication, ability, and creativity in writing and recording "Every Student Known" and its
Spanish-language counterpart, "Cada Estudiante Valorado"; and
WHEREAS, toward the end of the 2023-2024 school year, MNPS's Visual and
Performing Arts director, Franklin Willis, put out a call for students from across the district to
contribute their thoughts about what the concept "every student known" means to them; the
district then convened for a four-day songwriting summit in the summer of 2024, with students
visiting Capitol Christian Music Group and recording at Universal Music Group (UMG)
Nashville's studio in Berry Hill; and
WHEREAS, students worked with two MNPS music specialists, DaJuana Hammonds
and Bryson Finney, to write and record the song; Capitol Christian Music Group and UMG
Nashville donated their studios and services, and Music Makes Us paid for the production of a
music video and a nine-minute documentary about the students and the recording process; and
WHEREAS, the heartwarming documentary Every Student Known: The Creation of an
Anthem witnesses the power of music as it brings together students of all backgrounds,

fostering a sense of unity and community; through candid interviews, behind-the-scenes
footage, and the final performance, the film shows how collaboration, determination, and
passion can lead to something truly extraordinary; and
WHEREAS, the documentary won a Midsouth Emmy from the National Academy of
Television Arts & Sciences on February 15, 2025; and
WHEREAS, "Every Student Known," which debuted at an event on Music Row in the
summer of 2024, is available on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube, as is the Spanish-
language version of the song, "Cada Estudiante Valorado," which was translated by Manuel
Delgado of Delgado Guitars and released to YouTube on February 20, 2025; and
WHEREAS, Director Franklin Willis and his team have worked on a curriculum based on
the song that has been made available to arts educators throughout the district; and
WHEREAS, the talented students who created and participated in "Every Student
Known" are Leslie Hammonds, Ariah McEwen, Savannah Bell, Kingston Kharif, Kinston Smith,
Jordyn Harris, Darren Sadler, Zoe Sobecki, Corinne Bryan, Luca McLaughlin, and Journei
Butler; and

Valorado" are Enrique Jahuey-Muthe, Gabriella Flores-Rodriguez, Michelle Chourio, Jetzibell
Cardona, Luzaida Garzon, Andres Ledezma, Angel Lopez Diaz, and Jason Rios; and
WHEREAS, these students helped bring to life the message behind the concept "every
student known": working every day to understand every student's talents, interests, passions,
and possibilities while helping them to overcome challenges; and
WHEREAS, it is most fitting that we honor the hard work and talent of the students of
Metro Nashville Public Schools as well as their beautiful song and outstanding documentary;
now, therefore,
