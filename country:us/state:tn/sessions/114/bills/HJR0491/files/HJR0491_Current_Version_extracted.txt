HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 491
By Keisling
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Stephanie Boshears
upon her receipt of the Milken Educator Award.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause to
specially recognize those outstanding teachers who have devoted their careers to providing the
highest-quality education for Tennessee's students; and
WHEREAS, Stephanie Boshears is one such estimable educator, who has distinguished
herself as a professional of the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity; and
WHEREAS, a third-grade teacher at Oneida Elementary School, Ms. Boshears was
recently named a recipient of the prestigious Milken Educator Award, a most befitting honor that
recognizes the positive influence she has on so many young lives; and
WHEREAS, established in 1987, the Milken Educator Awards were created to attract,
reward, and retain the highest caliber professionals in the education profession; the award
recognizes early-to-mid career teachers and principals for both their impressive achievements
and the promise of future accomplishments; and

Tennessee joined the Milken Educator Award program in 1992, seventy-four Tennessee
educators have been awarded over $1.8 million; and
WHEREAS, Stephanie Boshears serves as a leader in her community, school, and
district; through her unwavering commitment to student success, she is known to consistently
set high standards and expectations for her students and pursues opportunities to enhance her
own learning; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Boshears has conducted many professional development sessions at
the school and district level, while using evidence from her classroom to foster an environment
in which student work drives teacher learning and leads to high-quality support for students
across all learning levels; and
