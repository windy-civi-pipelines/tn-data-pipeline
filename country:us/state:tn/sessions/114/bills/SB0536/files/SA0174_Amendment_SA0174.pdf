by deleting all language after the caption and substituting:
WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds and declares it public policy that institutions and
their athletic programs are encouraged to compete nationally, attract elite talent, and provide the
support necessary to grow the economy of this State and its sports and entertainment industry,
thereby advancing, promoting, and protecting the interests of intercollegiate athletes; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee institutions and their athletic programs need certainty to future
proof their ability to compete in a fluid national collegiate athletics landscape, preserve their
ability to comply with pending court settlements, and safeguard the State's sovereign immunity;
and
WHEREAS, it is contrary to public policy for an institution's athletic association
transacting business in Tennessee to create anticompetitive restrictions that lessen, or tend to
lessen, full and free competition in trade or commerce affecting this State or to otherwise violate
state and federal law; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:

(b)
- 2 - 005662

(1)
(A) A third party, including, but not limited to, an institution and its
affiliated foundations, or a third party authorized to act on behalf of such
institution or affiliated foundation, may facilitate, offer, and provide
compensation described in subsection (a) to an intercollegiate athlete
unless expressly prohibited or limited by:
(i) Federal law;
(ii) A valid court order with binding jurisdiction over an
institution and its intercollegiate athletes; or
(iii) An institution's athletic association that satisfies the
requirements in subdivision (b)(3).
(B) A third party acting or purporting to act on behalf of an
institution or its affiliated foundation pursuant to this subdivision (b)(1)
shall provide the intercollegiate athlete, upon request by the
intercollegiate athlete, with written evidence and the ability to verify such
evidence with the institution or its affiliated foundation within one (1) week
of the request; provided, that if the third party does not comply with the
request in a timely manner or the intercollegiate athlete is otherwise
unable to verify authorization, then, upon notice by the intercollegiate
athlete, any contract entered into between an unauthorized third party
and an intercollegiate athlete is deemed null and void from its inception
without penalty, loss, or fault.
(2) Neither a grant-in-aid for athletics awarded to an intercollegiate
athlete by an institution, including the cost of attendance, nor an institution's or its
affiliated foundation's involvement in support of name, image, or likeness
activities under this part constitutes compensation to, or representation of, an
intercollegiate athlete by the institution for purposes of § 49-7-2802. Such
- 3 - 005662

institutional and affiliated foundation involvement shall be in furtherance of public
policy and may include, but not be limited to, entering into or otherwise
participating in any business arrangements with third parties that may provide
economic incentives, foster start-ups, make investments, explore business
combinations, develop licensing opportunities, or involve any other commercial
activity that directly or indirectly benefits the state, the institution, the affiliated
foundation, intercollegiate athletes, or industry participants.
(3) Regardless of the source of authority of an institution's athletic
association pursuant to subdivisions (b)(1) or (b)(2), or any of its arrangements,
agreements, contracts, transactions, settlements, or vote of any kind, the athletic
association shall:
(A) Preserve all rights afforded to intercollegiate athletes under
applicable state and federal law;
(B) Preserve all immunities and rights available to each of its
member institutions under applicable state and federal law;
(C) Not establish, adopt, promulgate, implement, or enforce any
rule, standard, procedure, policy, or guideline that violates an applicable
state or federal antitrust law and, prior to any implementation or
enforcement thereof. The athletic association must ensure that any
action or conduct expected to be carried out, executed, required, or
otherwise performed thereunder by any institution, its affiliated
foundation, the athletic association itself, an intercollege athlete, or an
authorized third party thereof is and will be legally exempt from applicable
antitrust laws and meets the requirements of subdivisions (b)(3)(A) and
(B), regardless of whether a choice or option is made available by the
association; and
- 4 - 005662

(D) Not directly or indirectly condition, threaten, lessen, refuse,
remove, terminate, cancel, circumvent, penalize, disrupt, or otherwise
interfere with, in any way or degree, an institution's full enjoyment of its
current and future membership, status, or any related rights in the same,
including, but not limited to, voting rights, participation in athletic events,
broadcasts, revenue, or athlete eligibility based, in whole or part, on such
association's failure to adhere to, uphold, or otherwise satisfy the
requirements of this subdivision (b)(3) or any applicable law.
(4) An institution's athletic association shall not create or impose unfair,
anticompetitive, or unlawful conditions that directly or indirectly compel an
institution or intercollegiate athlete to participate under such conditions or risk
violating state or federal law, regardless of whether a choice or option is made
available by the association. The availability of a choice, vote, authorization, or
mitigation attempt of any kind does not absolve or relieve the athletic association
of its obligations under subdivision (b)(3) or this subdivision (b)(4). The
requirements of subdivision (b)(3) and this subdivision (b)(4) apply irrespective of
a party's participation in such conditions. The athletic association shall fully
indemnify and hold harmless the state, its institutions, and intercollegiate athletes
from any damages, losses, claims, or remedies of any kind arising from its
noncompliance or failure under such applicable law. Any violation of subdivision
(b)(3) is unenforceable against institutions and intercollegiate athletes without
penalty, loss, or fault.
(c) An institution and its affiliated foundations must not be held liable to a third
party or an intercollegiate athlete for any damages, losses, or claims of any kind
resulting from, or related to, its good faith decisions, actions, or involvement in name,
image, or likeness activities taken in the course of its participation in intercollegiate
athletics or matters otherwise concerning § 49-7-2802. This chapter, including § 49-7-
- 5 - 005662

2802, does not waive or abrogate, in any way, sovereign immunity or any other right of
immunity available at law.
(d) Intercollegiate athletes who earn third-party compensation pursuant to
subsection (a) may be required to disclose any agreement and the terms of such
agreement, subject to any commercially reasonable terms or conditions contained
therein, to an athletic association or an institution, and file annual reports at a time and in
a manner designated by the athletic association or the institution.
(e) Any diligence performed, or compensation earned, does not affect the
intercollegiate athlete's grant-in-aid or athletic eligibility. To the extent that intercollegiate
athletes receive need-based financial aid, an institution may adjust an intercollegiate
athlete's need-based financial aid as a result of compensation earned under this part in
the same manner as the institution would for other students with equivalent levels of
financial need.
(f) An institution may adopt reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions to
prevent an intercollegiate athlete's name, image, or likeness activities from interfering
with team activities, the institution's operations, or the use of the institution's facilities, or
where an athlete is engaged, or expected to be engaged, in any academic or athletic
program activities at the institution.
(g)
(1) An institution may prohibit an intercollegiate athlete's involvement in
name, image, and likeness activities that are reasonably considered to be in
conflict with the values of the institution.
(2) An institution may prohibit use of the institution's intellectual property,
including, but not limited to, its trademarks, trade dress, and copyrights, by the
institution's intercollegiate athletes in the athletes' personal name, image, and
likeness activities.
- 6 - 005662

(3) Intercollegiate athletes are prohibited from involvement in name,
image, or likeness activities that promote gambling, tobacco,
tetrahydrocannabinol products or derivatives, alcohol, and adult entertainment.
(h)
(1) An intercollegiate athlete may obtain representation by a third party,
including, but not limited to, an athlete agent, for the purpose of performing
diligence and securing compensation contemplated pursuant to this part. Any
third-party representative of an intercollegiate athlete under this part is a fiduciary
for the represented intercollegiate athlete. All athlete agents who represent
intercollegiate athletes under this part for purposes of securing compensation
must be licensed under § 49-7-2104, and must satisfy the requirements of
chapter 7, part 21 of this title. If the athlete's representative is an attorney who
represents an intercollegiate athlete for purposes of performing diligence and
securing compensation, then the attorney must be active and in good standing
with the board of professional responsibility or equivalent entity in the state in
which the attorney is licensed.
(2) Parents, siblings, grandparents, spouses, and legal guardians of an
intercollegiate athlete who represent the intercollegiate athlete for the purpose of
performing diligence and securing compensation for the use of the intercollegiate
athlete's name, image, or likeness are not considered to be athlete agents for
purposes of this part and are not subject to the requirements for athlete agents
as prescribed by this part or part 21 of this chapter.
(3) An institution and its affiliated foundations who assist, facilitate, or
otherwise provide support to an intercollegiate athlete for the purpose of
performing diligence and securing third-party compensation contemplated under
subsections (a) and (b) are not athlete agents for purposes of this part, and are
not subject to the requirements for athlete agents as prescribed by this part or
- 7 - 005662

part 21 of this chapter; provided, that an individual of such institution or affiliated
foundation shall not have a direct pecuniary or financial interest in the specific
terms of the intercollegiate athlete's third-party compensation other than a third-
party agreement described in subdivision (b)(1), and such individual does not
coerce, compel, or interfere with an intercollegiate athlete's decision to earn such
compensation.
(i)
(1) An intercollegiate athlete or the athlete's representative shall not enter
into an agreement for compensation pursuant to subsection (a) if the agreement
conflicts or unreasonably competes with the terms of an existing agreement
entered into at any time by the institution the athlete attends or its affiliated
foundations.
(2) The institution or affiliated foundation asserting a conflict or
unreasonable competition under this subsection (i) shall disclose the relevant
terms of the institution's existing agreement that conflicts or unreasonably
competes with the athlete's agreement to the intercollegiate athlete or the
athlete's representative.
(j) Any agreement entered into by an intercollegiate athlete under eighteen (18)
years of age for the use of the athlete's name, image, or likeness must be in accordance
with the Tennessee Protection of Minor Performers Act, compiled in title 50, chapter 5,
part 2.
(k) An agreement for representation of an intercollegiate athlete must not be in
effect any longer than the duration of the athlete's participation in an athletic program at
an institution. If an intercollegiate athlete enters into a third-party agreement other than
an agreement described in subdivision (b)(1), and the agreement with the third party is in
conflict with an athlete's eligibility to participate in an athletic program at an institution, or
will prevent an athlete from participating in any athletic program event, then the
- 8 - 005662

agreement must be immediately rescinded or modified to adequately remove the defect
and preserve the athlete's eligibility prior to participating in the athletic program or the
event and, if the agreement is not timely resolved or the third party is otherwise in
default, then the athlete has the right to have such agreement immediately deemed null
and void from its inception, and all rights under the agreement must immediately revert
to the athlete without fault, loss, or penalty.
(l) Institutions shall conduct a financial literacy workshop for intercollegiate
athletes during the athlete's first full-time term of enrollment. The workshop must cover,
at a minimum, information related to the requirements of this part, budgeting, and debt
management. An institution and its affiliated foundations may contract with qualified
persons or entities to conduct the workshop.
(m)
(1) Notwithstanding § 10-7-503 or another law to the contrary, any
records, materials, information, or other data received, developed, generated,
ascertained, or discovered in the course of diligence, compensation, or other
activities pursuant to § 49-7-2802, including, but not limited to, planning,
strategies, recruitment, eligibility, competition, marketing, commercial
opportunities, financial strategies, or other matters pertaining thereto, regardless
of physical form or characteristics, are confidential and not subject to public
inspection under the open records laws.
(2) Notwithstanding subdivision (m)(1), upon an institution receiving a
public records request pursuant to the open records laws, compiled in title 10,
chapter 7, the institution shall make available annualized, aggregated
compensation data representing actual amounts provided by such institution to
its intercollegiate athletes for an academic year pursuant to § 49-7-2802(b)(1) for
an intercollegiate athlete's name, image, and likeness; provided, however, such
data must not reveal any personally identifiable information of an intercollegiate
- 9 - 005662

athlete protected under state or federal law nor reveal any proprietary business
information of a third party, including confidential commercial terms.
(3) The attorney general and reporter or a state agency performing an
official function may review all records, materials, or other information subject to
this subsection (m); provided, however, that any information obtained remains
confidential and is not subject to disclosure.
(4) This subsection (m) does not prohibit voluntary disclosure by an
intercollegiate athlete, the athlete's representative, an institution, an affiliated
foundation, or an authorized third party.
(5) This subsection (m) is repealed on July 1, 2032.
49-7-2803.
(a) An institution's athletic association shall not:
(1) Interfere with, prohibit, restrict, or otherwise adversely affect an
intercollegiate athlete's ability to earn compensation, seek representation,
perform diligence, or otherwise participate in an activity described in § 49-7-2802
and shall not otherwise impact an intercollegiate athlete's eligibility or full
participation in intercollege athletic events;
(2) Interfere with, prohibit, restrict, or otherwise punish an institution and
its affiliated foundation for participating in an activity described in § 49-7-2802;
(3) Threaten, condition, or cause an institution or a governing body of this
state to repeal any state law and suffer any detrimental harm, economic or
otherwise, in order to participate in such association and enjoy its full rights of
membership or otherwise thereunder; or
(4) Violate § 49-7-2802(b)(4); unless, in each case, this part is
invalidated or rendered unenforceable by operation of law. The attorney general
and reporter may bring any appropriate action or proceeding against an
- 10 - 005662

institution's athletic association in any court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to
this part.
(b) This section does not authorize, create, or afford any private cause of action,
liability, or basis for injunctive or equitable relief by any private person or entity by virtue
of such party's or entity's relationship with an institution's athletic association.
SECTION 2. If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance
is held invalid, then the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the act that
can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the provisions of
this act are severable.
SECTION 3. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
