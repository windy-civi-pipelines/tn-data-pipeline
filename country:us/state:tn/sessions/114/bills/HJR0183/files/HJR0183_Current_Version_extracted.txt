HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 183
By Rudd
A RESOLUTION to honor Dr. James Michael Norris on the
occasion of his retirement from ministry.
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that this General Assembly should honor those citizens who
have answered a divine call to the ministry and who have served with dedication, vigor, and
enthusiasm to perform God's work for their congregations and their communities; and
WHEREAS, Dr. James Michael Norris is one such estimable person, who will take his
much-deserved retirement from his role as pastor of Franklin Road Baptist Church in
Murfreesboro; and
WHEREAS, born in Ripley, West Virginia, and raised in nearby Evans, Dr. Norris grew
up in a Christian home, and after marrying his high school sweetheart, Mila, in 1978 and
experiencing the loss of his grandfather, he felt a summons to minister to God's people; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Norris went on to study at Appalachian Bible College, where he received
his bachelor's degree, and Louisiana Baptist University, where he received his master's degree;
and

from 1987 to 1989; and
WHEREAS, in 1989, Ripley Baptist Temple asked Dr. Norris to become their senior
pastor, a position in which he served for ten years, and while working through the daily,
significant pains of rheumatoid arthritis, his faithful and faith-filled presence grew the
congregation from only eighty-eight members to an average of 500 attendants each Sunday,
with the size burgeoning to 700 for larger events; and

WHEREAS, in 1999, Dr. Norris felt another call of ministry, this time to Franklin Road
Baptist Church in Murfreesboro, where he has led his flock for over twenty-five years; and
WHEREAS, the community has seen remarkable growth, both spiritually and physically,
under Dr. Norris's leadership: consistently recording over 1,000 in attendance, even numbering
over 2,300 on some Sundays; expanding to thirty-five acres with new facilities; investing in the
thriving Franklin Road Christian School; and helping support over 200 ministries across the
world; and
WHEREAS, as a member of boards for the Tennessee Association of Christian Schools,
West Coast Baptist College, and Baptist International Missions, Inc., Dr. Norris has shared his
great spiritual wealth and wonderful companionship with far more than just his local
congregation, and his long tenure has impacted multiple generations of believers across a wide
spectrum; and
WHEREAS, his mentorship and compassionate care for other pastors, missionaries, and
servants of God have ensured that there will be more laborers for the harvest in his absence;
and
WHEREAS, Dr. Norris and his wife are blessed with their son, Joel, who married his high
school sweetheart, Lauren, and they are even further blessed by their three beautiful
grandchildren; and
WHEREAS, Dr. Norris is a living icon of God's work, whether through his consistent
virtue and empathy or his gift of human relation, and he has multiplied the kingdom of God
through his shepherding; and
WHEREAS, throughout his estimable and devout career as a minister, Dr. James
Michael Norris has evinced the utmost spirituality, ability, and integrity, winning the unbridled
respect and admiration of his congregation; and
