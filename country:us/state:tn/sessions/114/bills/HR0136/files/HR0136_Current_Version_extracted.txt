A RESOLUTION to honor the incomparable Anita Ward.
WHEREAS, the members of this legislative body take great pleasure in recognizing a
gifted singer whose music has brought joy to millions of people around the globe; and
WHEREAS, a native of Memphis, Anita Ward is universally known for her 1979 million-
selling, chart-topping R&B/disco hit "Ring My Bell"; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Ward earned a degree in psychology from Rust College and embarked
upon a teaching career before signing a recording contract in the late 1970s; and
WHEREAS, while recording her debut album, Songs of Love, Anita Ward was presented
with a song that was intended to capitalize on the current disco trend in music; although she
was reluctant at first, she agreed to record "Ring My Bell" as a dance track; and
WHEREAS, the resulting single made history, as "Ring My Bell" quickly earned Gold
classification and shot up to No. 1 on the Hot 100, R&B, and Dance charts in the United States,

she took another hiatus from the industry to focus on raising her daughter; and
WHEREAS, Anita Ward returned to the spotlight on New Year's Eve 2002, performing
"Ring My Bell" in New York City's Times Square before one million revelers as part of the city's
official celebration; and
