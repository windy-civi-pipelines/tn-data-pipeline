application for ballot must include a space for the address of the voter's current
residence, and the voter shall write or print such address on the application when the
voter signs the application for ballot.

address of the voter applies to persons voting pursuant to § 2-6-109; provided, however,
that a person voting in accordance with § 2-6-401(a) and (b) or § 2-6-601 is not required
to show an identification with a photograph and residential address of the voter.

is entitled to vote, the registrar shall initial the application, note the date of the election,

the voter applies to vote.
(F) If the applicant's signature is illegible, the registrar shall print the name on the
application.
