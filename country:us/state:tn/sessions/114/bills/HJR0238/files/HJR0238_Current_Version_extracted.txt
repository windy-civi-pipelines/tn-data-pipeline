Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 238
By Jones J
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Bad Idea, named one of
the best restaurants in the country.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should recognize those exemplary small businesses that,
through their unwavering commitment to excellence, are a credit to this State; and
WHEREAS, one such notable establishment is Bad Idea in East Nashville, which was
selected by The New York Times as one of fifty restaurants on its definitive Restaurant List for
2024, which recognizes the best restaurants across the country, and included on USA TODAY's
2025 Restaurants of the Year list; and
WHEREAS, located inside what was once a church building at 1021 Russell Street, Bad
Idea is a wine bar that specializes in envelope-pushing Lao food; the concept was brought to life
in 2023 by Alex Burch, a seasoned sommelier and first-time restaurateur; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Burch brought on as executive chef Colby Rasavong, who grew up
working in his Laotian family's Thai restaurant and formerly served as the top lieutenant to Sean
Brock; he is noted as investing "the weight of his life experience in food that stretches the
boundaries of Southeast Asian cooking to the edge of Appalachia"; and
WHEREAS, the menu opens with shareable starters like nam khao croquettes served
with jeow mak len (a Lao tomato dipping sauce) before segueing into scallop-stuffed crepes with
nam prik blanquette and Anson Mills broken rice porridge served with egg, wild mushrooms,
and ginger; and
WHEREAS, larger format dishes include a bucksnort trout served with turmeric crepes,
Bear Creek pork collar with scallion crepes, and chicken served two ways, featuring khao piak
(wet rice noodles) prepared with local Proper Sake udon and pickled dark meat and a serving of
chicken rice with fold-in crispy skin and chicken fat; and

WHEREAS, with his extensive wine background, Alex Burch decided to focus Bad Idea
around a wine program that celebrates variety in style, origin, and availability; the wine list offers
at least three dozen wines by the glass and more than 100 bottles, including a variety of
Madeiras, Champagnes, ciders, beers, and classic cocktails, and a selection that features spicy
food-friendly rieslings, exceptional skin-contact wines, an interesting collection of pinot noirs,
and a couple of big Napa Valley cabs; and
WHEREAS, the design of the restaurant is perhaps as impactful as what it serves;
longtime developer Mark Sanders of East Nashville purchased and then renovated the 19,000-
square-foot church and former YMCA after it was severely damaged in a tornado; Bad Idea
occupies more than 5,000 square feet of space, with twenty-five-foot curved ceilings and tall
windows that welcome in the fading light as the sun sets; and
WHEREAS, interiors were handled by local studio Design Object and feature a
sprawling horseshoe bar in the middle of the dining room, emphasizing comfortable lounge and
bar seating; the church's original windows and soaring ceilings were left intact and lend the
light-filled space a sense of ethereal elegance, while a stained-glass fixture over the bar and
pew-like dining banquettes nod to the space's former life as a house of worship; and
WHEREAS, in addition to recognition from The New York Times and USA TODAY, Bad
Idea has garnered praise and accolades from Wine Enthusiast, Eater Nashville, The
Tennessean, The Infatuation, Bon Appétit, Robb Report, Nashville Business Journal, Style
Blueprint, Nashville Lifestyles, Nashville Post, and NASHtoday; and
WHEREAS, Bad Idea is a fantastic recent addition to Nashville's ever-growing culinary
landscape, and we are most fortunate and proud that this restaurant calls Tennessee home;
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
- 2 - 003632
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend proprietor Alex Burch, executive chef Colby
Rasavong, and the employees of Bad Idea in East Nashville, congratulating them on their
recent recognition as one of the best restaurants in the country and extending our best wishes
for every continued success.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
