HOUSE BILL 1035
By Lamberth
SENATE BILL 112
By Johnson
AN ACT to revise and codify the general and public
statutes of the State of Tennessee, to the extent
incorporated herein, as a part of Tennessee Code
Annotated; to provide in case of any conflict
between Acts of the regular or any extraordinary
2025 Session of the General Assembly and this
Act, the former shall be controlling, regardless of
the respective dates of passage or approval; and
to repeal all acts or parts of acts codified in this
Act.
WHEREAS, each year, the General Assembly passes a codification bill, which reenacts
the general acts of a permanent nature that were enacted by the General Assembly in the
preceding year; and
WHEREAS, the annual codification bill makes no substantive changes to the content of
the State's body of law; the bill simply integrates recent public acts into the Tennessee Code to
make such code, in its updated form, the official compilation of the laws of this State; and
WHEREAS, because it contains the statutory text of almost every general bill passed by
the preceding year's General Assembly, the annual codification bill is always quite lengthy; the
2025 codification bill is composed of two volumes, which total more than 2,540 pages; and
WHEREAS, because of the length of the bill, its contents are being made available
electronically; the contents may be accessed by legislative staff and members on the "common
(G)" drive, in the folder entitled "Codification Bill." The volumes may also be accessed by
legislative staff, members, and the public on the legislature's website at the following link:
http://www.capitol.tn.gov/legislation/publications/index.html; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. The General and Public Laws of the State of Tennessee, to the extent
SB0112
000933
- 1 -

incorporated herein, on revisal shall be a part of Tennessee Code Annotated as follows, to wit:
(Contents of bill attached)
SECTION 2. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
