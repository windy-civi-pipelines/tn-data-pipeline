Section 9:
SECTION 8. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 35, Chapter 15, Part 8, is amended by

(a) Unless the terms of a trust instrument expressly provide that a settlor shall
not be reimbursed by a trust for the settlor's personal income tax liability attributable to
the trust, if the settlor of a trust is treated under 26 U.S.C. § 671 et seq. as the owner of
all or part of the trust, then a disinterested trustee, in the disinterested trustee's sole
discretion, or another trustee at the direction of a trust advisor or trust protector who
would be treated as a disinterested trustee and otherwise has the power to direct
discretionary distributions under the trust instrument, may reimburse the settlor for any
amount of the settlor's personal federal, state, local, foreign, or other income tax liability
that is attributable to the inclusion of the trust's income, capital gains, deductions, and
credits in the calculation of the settlor's taxable income under principals of 26 U.S.C. §
671 et seq. The trustee may pay such amount to the settlor directly, or may pay the
- 4 - 003684
amount to an appropriate taxing authority on the settlor's behalf, as the trustee
determines in the trustee's sole discretion. This power shall in all cases be exercised in
the sole and absolute discretion of a disinterested trustee or trust advisor or protector
who would be treated as a disinterested trustee, and no settlor or other person may
compel the exercise of this power or enter into an express or implied agreement or
understanding regarding the exercise of such power. No policy of insurance on the
settlor's life held in the trust nor the cash value of any such policy, nor the proceeds of
any loan secured by an interest in the policy may be used to reimburse the settlor or to
pay an appropriate taxing authority on the settlor's behalf. Neither the trustee's power to
make payments to, or for the benefit of, the settlor under this section, nor the trustee's
decision to exercise such power in favor of the settlor, causes the settlor to be treated as
a beneficiary of the trust for any purpose.
(b) This section does not apply if the application of this section would disqualify a
trust for, or reduce the amount of, a marital deduction, a charitable deduction, or another
specific tax benefit otherwise available to any person for state or federal income, gift,
estate, or generation-skipping transfer tax purposes.
(c) The power described in this section becomes exercisable on and after
December 31, 2025, and applies to trusts existing before, on, and after such date.
(d) The person otherwise having the power to exercise the discretion described
in this section may at any time renounce the power in writing and, unless otherwise
limited, such renouncement applies permanently with respect to the trust as a whole,
such that a person does not have this power with respect to the trust at any time after
the renunciation.
(e) A person is not liable for exercising or failing to exercise the power described
in this section, or for exercising or failing to exercise the ability to renounce such power.

Section 10:
SECTION 9. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 35-15-1005, is amended by adding
the following new subsection:
- 5 - 003684
(f) For purposes of this section, a person is deemed to have actual knowledge of
information that is accessible by the person through electronic means if the person
provided consent to receive information by electronic means in a record, as defined in §
47-10-102, and such consent has not been revoked. The information is deemed to be
accessible by the person if:
(1) The means of electronic access were provided in the record; or
(2) It can be shown that the electronic access was actually utilized at any
time.

Section 11:
SECTION 10. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 35-15-1102, is amended by deleting
the last sentence and substituting "However, the execution of an inter vivos trust instrument, a
document to transfer an asset to or from a trust, or a consent, release, ratification, modification,
termination, or settlement agreement pursuant to § 35-15-109, § 35-15-111, § 35-15-411, or §
35-15-412 is considered a transaction for purposes of § 47-10-103.".

Section 12:
SECTION 11. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 35-15-1202, is amended by deleting
the section and substituting:
(a) A trust advisor or trust protector, other than a beneficiary, is a fiduciary with
respect to each power granted to such trust advisor or trust protector. In exercising a
power or refraining from exercising a power, a trust advisor or trust protector acting as a
fiduciary shall act in good faith and in accordance with the terms and purposes of the
trust and the interests of the beneficiaries.
(b) A trust advisor or trust protector is an excluded fiduciary, regardless of
whether the trust advisor or trust protector is serving in a fiduciary capacity, with respect
to each power granted or reserved exclusively to any one (1) or more other trustees,
trust advisors, or trust protectors.
(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a trust advisor or trust protector may serve in
a nonfiduciary capacity when specifically appointed in such capacity, and when acting in
such capacity is liable only for acting in bad faith or with reckless indifference.

SECTION 12. The Tennessee Code Commission is requested to publish in Tennessee
Code Annotated the revisions required to conform to the current state of the law the official
comments for Chapter 1 of Title 30 and Chapter 15 of Title 35 that are filed with the executive
secretary of the Tennessee Code Commission by May 19, 2025, by duly authorized
