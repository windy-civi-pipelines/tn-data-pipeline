A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Agape Child & Family
Services on the occasion of its fifty-fifth

WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should specially

hope and healing to families right where they live, providing wraparound services to lift and
strengthen them; and

children missing school, such as family responsibilities, transportation problems, illness, and
behavioral issues, by providing support both in and out of the classroom; and
WHEREAS, Agape's workforce readiness program promotes parent and adult self-
sufficiency by addressing barriers to attaining education, employment, and financial
empowerment, enabling families to experience success and find opportunities; and
