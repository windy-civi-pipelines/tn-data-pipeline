SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 15
By Johnson
A RESOLUTION to recognize Human Trafficking Awareness
Month, January 2025.
WHEREAS, human trafficking is defined as the recruitment, manipulation, purchasing, or
obtaining of a person for the purpose of commercial sex acts or forced labor through the use of
force, fraud, deception, or coercion; and
WHEREAS, human trafficking victims can be of any age, sex, race, or background, with
particularly vulnerable populations, including children, survivors of child abuse, runaway and
homeless youth, victims of interpersonal and intimate partner violence, individuals struggling
with substance use disorders, and those impacted by conflict, poverty, or the failure of systems
meant to support community members in their time of need; and
WHEREAS, human trafficking encompasses prostitution, escorting, online
advertisements, digital platforms, and all forms of commercial sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, the existence of human trafficking in today's society recognizes that, for
many, the perceived "choice" to sell one's body arises from a lack of safer, more accessible,
and dignified options and resources; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee is home to several organizations that provide direct support
services and advocate on behalf of survivors of human trafficking, prostitution, and commercial
sexual exploitation; and
WHEREAS, the office of the Tennessee Secretary of State launched the Tennessee
Businesses Against Trafficking Program, making it a statewide priority to educate Tennessee
business owners on the signs of human trafficking; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is required to submit an annual
report on child and human trafficking crimes and trends; and

apart families and communities; fuels interpersonal violence; and undermines the security of
society at large; and

tools to identify and address human trafficking, support survivors, prevent exploitation, and hold
perpetrators accountable; now, therefore,

GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we recognize Human Trafficking Awareness Month,
January 2025.
