WHEREAS, Addison McBroom is one such exceptional student, who has become the

each week; and

Community College, diligently pursuing an associate degree while balancing her high school

steadfast commitment of time and talent, Ms. McBroom has achieved outstanding academic
success and joined the ranks of the best and brightest students in Tennessee and our country;
