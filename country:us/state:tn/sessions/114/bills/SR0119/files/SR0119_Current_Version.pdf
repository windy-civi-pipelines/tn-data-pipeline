SENATE RESOLUTION 119
By Lamar
A RESOLUTION to recognize the week of April 11 through April
17, 2025, as Black Maternal Health Week.
WHEREAS, Black Maternal Health Week was founded by Black Mamas Matter Alliance,
Inc., to bring national attention to the maternal and reproductive health crisis in the United
States and the importance of reducing maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women
and birthing persons; and
WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Black
women in the United States are two to three times more likely than White women to die from
pregnancy-related causes; and
WHEREAS, Black women and people living in low-income and rural communities in the
United States are the most likely to suffer from life-threatening pregnancy complications, known
as "maternal morbidities"; and
WHEREAS, maternal mortality rates in the United States are among the highest in the
developed world, with 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020, 32.9 in 2021, 22.3 in 2022,
and 18.6 in 2023; and
WHEREAS, the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among affluent
countries, in part because of the disproportionate mortality rate of Black women; and
WHEREAS, according to the 2025 CDC Report, in 2023, the U.S. maternal mortality rate
decreased for White (14.5), Hispanic (12.4), and Asian (10.7) women but increased to 50.3
deaths per 100,000 live births for Black women; and
WHEREAS, Black women are fifty percent more likely than all other women to give birth
to premature, low birthweight, and very low birthweight infants; and

WHEREAS, the high rates of maternal mortality among Black women span across
income levels, education levels, and socioeconomic status; and
WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that more than
eighty percent of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable; and
WHEREAS, the leading causes of maternal mortality among Black women and birthing
persons include eclampsia, preeclampsia, postpartum cardiomyopathy, and obstetric embolism,
and these conditions impact Black women and birthing people disproportionately; and
WHEREAS, structural racism, gender oppression, and the social determinants of health
inequities experienced by Black women in the United States significantly contribute to the
disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality and morbidity among Black women; and
WHEREAS, racism and discrimination play a consequential role in maternal healthcare
experiences and outcomes of Black birthing people; and
WHEREAS, the overturn of Roe v. Wade impacts Black women's and birthing people's
right to reproductive health care and bodily autonomy and further perpetuates reproductive
oppression as a tool to control women's bodies; and
WHEREAS, a fair and wide distribution of resources and birth options, especially with
regard to reproductive healthcare services and maternal health programming, is critical to
addressing inequities in maternal health outcomes; and
WHEREAS, states and rural counties with higher Black population rates have severe
maternity care deserts, where there are no hospitals or birth centers offering obstetric care nor
any obstetric providers, and there is diminished access to reproductive healthcare providers due
to low Medicaid reimbursements, rising costs, and persistent healthcare workforce shortages;
and
- 2 - 006549

WHEREAS, maternity care deserts lead to higher risks of maternal morbidity and
mortality, as most complications occur in the postpartum period when birthing people are far
away from their providers; and
WHEREAS, Black midwives, doulas, perinatal health workers, and community-based
organizations provide holistic maternal care and support but face structural and legal barriers to
licensure, reimbursement, and provision of care; and
WHEREAS, Black women and birthing persons experience increased barriers to
accessing prenatal and postpartum care, including maternal mental health care; and
WHEREAS, even as there is growing concern about improving access to mental health
services, Black women are least likely to have access to mental health screenings, treatment,
and support before, during, and after pregnancy; and
WHEREAS, Black pregnant and postpartum workers are disproportionately denied
reasonable accommodations in the workplace, leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes; and
WHEREAS, Black pregnant people disproportionately experience surveillance and
punishment, including shackling incarcerated people during labor, drug testing mothers and
infants without informed consent, separating mothers from their newborns, and criminalizing
pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage; and
WHEREAS, Black women and birthing people experience pervasive racial injustice in
the criminal justice, social, and healthcare systems; and
WHEREAS, justice-informed, culturally congruent models of care are beneficial to Black
women; and
WHEREAS, an investment must be made in:
(1) Maternity care for Black women and birthing persons, including care led by the
communities most affected by the maternal health crisis;
- 3 - 006549

(2) Continuous health insurance coverage to support Black women and birthing persons
for the full postpartum period at least one year after giving birth; and
(3) Policies that support and promote affordable, comprehensive, and holistic maternal
health care that is free from gender and racial discrimination, regardless of incarceration;
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we recognize the week of April
11 through April 17, 2025, as Black Maternal Health Week to underscore the importance of
