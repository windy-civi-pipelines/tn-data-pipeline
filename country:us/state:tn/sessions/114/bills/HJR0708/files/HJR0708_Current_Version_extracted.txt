play on an actual Ringer court and ended up meeting Coach Brian Cherry; and

losing only two of those (which were split between his own Tennessee teammates) for a record
of 68-2; and

the people of Nashville and Standing Stone; and
WHEREAS, Vincent Ruiz's initiative, dedication, and drive helped him claim the title of
