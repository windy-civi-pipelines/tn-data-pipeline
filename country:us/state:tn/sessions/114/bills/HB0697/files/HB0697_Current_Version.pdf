(4) The virtual school, or the public school providing the virtual education
program, strives to maintain a student to proctor ratio of no less than one (1)
proctor for every ten (10) students for the TCAP test being administered in a
virtual setting;
(5) The virtual school, or the public school providing the virtual education
program, does not allow a student who is administered the TCAP test in a virtual
setting to exit the room in which the test is being administered until instructed to
do so by the proctor; and
(6) The submission of the TCAP test administered to students in a virtual
setting must be verified by the assessment proctor.
(b) The department shall ensure that TCAP tests are available to be offered in a
virtual setting in accordance with this section.
(c) If the device on which a TCAP test is administered in a virtual setting does
not allow for integrated camera proctoring, then a student who is administered a TCAP
test in a virtual setting must use one (1) device to take the test and one (1) device for the
student to be video monitored by a proctor for the duration of the administration of the
test. If a second device is needed pursuant to this subsection (c), then the virtual
school, or the public school providing the virtual education program, must provide the
second device. This subsection (c) does not require the use of a second device if the
assessment platform allows for the assessment proctor to view the student and the
student's background during the assessment's administration.
(d) The department of education may adopt standards for the administration of
TCAP tests in virtual settings in accordance with this section to ensure that TCAP tests
are administered in a secure environment.
