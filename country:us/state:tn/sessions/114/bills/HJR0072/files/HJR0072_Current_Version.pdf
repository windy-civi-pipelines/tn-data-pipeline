HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 72
By Lynn
A RESOLUTION to honor Wilson County upon the 225th
anniversary of the county's founding.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly take great pleasure in joining with
the counties that comprise this great State in celebrating joyous and historic occasions; and
WHEREAS, bountiful and beautiful Wilson County and its citizens are most assuredly
deserving of special recognition, as they celebrated the 225th anniversary of the county's
founding on October 26, 2024; and
WHEREAS, Wilson County was named in honor of Major David Wilson, a native of
Pennsylvania, who came to Sumner County while it was still a part of North Carolina; he was
the first Speaker of the Territorial Assembly; and
WHEREAS, at that time, the Cumberland River was impassable for five or six months of
the year, making it very difficult for citizens to conduct their government affairs, so the people
who lived in the area petitioned to become a new county, with a county seat and government
offices for the citizens of the area to manage and carry on their business; and
WHEREAS, on October 26, 1799, Wilson County was allowed by the state legislature to
break away from Sumner County, which was a large area at the time, and form its own
government; and
WHEREAS, the citizens of Wilson County have added and continue to add
immeasurably to the strength and character of Tennessee; their history and accomplishments
have helped build the cultural richness for which this State is known; and
WHEREAS, Wilson County is one of the great counties in Tennessee, and it is most
appropriate that we honor this fine community and its citizenry as they commemorate this
significant milestone in their historic existence; now, therefore,
