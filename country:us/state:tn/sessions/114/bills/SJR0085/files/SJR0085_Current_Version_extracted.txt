SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 85
By Roberts
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of the four Donaldson
brothers of Dickson County on the occasion of
their posthumously receiving The Ambassador
For Peace Medal.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal safety and concerns to ensure our individual and collective freedom, and the Volunteer
State is especially proud to be the home of so many valiant men and women who performed
above and beyond the call of duty; and
WHEREAS, the citizens of Tennessee have, throughout the years, been called upon to
take up arms against the enemies of this great nation, risking their lives and leaving their loved
ones behind to honorably safeguard the freedoms and liberties guaranteed to all citizens of
these United States and vanquishing those who threaten our way of life; and
WHEREAS, while the heroic deeds of Tennesseans have been extolled throughout the
history of our State and nation, the distinguished military service of every proud Tennessean
should be illuminated, shared, and properly honored; and
WHEREAS, four such individuals are the Donaldson brothers of Dickson County, all of
whom served simultaneously in the U.S. Armed Forces during the Korean War, an American
record for that conflict; and
WHEREAS, on August 6, 2024, Thomas Harvel Donaldson, Ernest Melvin Donaldson,
Arie Gafford Donaldson, and Arthur Preston Donaldson were posthumously awarded The
Ambassador For Peace Medals by the Republic of South Korea as an expression of that
nation's appreciation; and
WHEREAS, the late Thomas Harvel Donaldson served in the U.S. Air Force in World
War II, Korea, and Vietnam; the late Ernest Melvin Donaldson served in the U.S. Army in Korea;

the late Arie Gafford Donaldson also served in the U.S. Army in Korea; and the late Arthur
Preston Donaldson served in the U.S. Army in Korea and Vietnam; and
WHEREAS, while no offering can properly relay our gratitude for their bravery and
dedication to preserving the blessed freedom that is inseparable from our American heritage
and ideals, it is most appropriate that we should honor the Donaldson brothers to the full extent
of our ability, as they made untold and innumerable sacrifices to preserve the liberties we enjoy
today; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that on the occasion of their posthumous receipt of The

most heroic citizens.
