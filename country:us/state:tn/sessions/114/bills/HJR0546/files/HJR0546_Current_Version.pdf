HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 546
By Jones R
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Alvin Murphy on his
receipt of the Governor's Volunteer Stars Award.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should specially
recognize those estimable citizens who have dedicated their time and energies to helping
others; and
WHEREAS, each year, 1.3 million Tennessee volunteers give over 99 million hours of
community service, contributing $2.6 billion to Tennessee's economy; and
WHEREAS, these volunteers are the backbone of our communities, and by donating
their time and talents to fulfill needs that would otherwise go unmet, they embody the spirit of
giving; and
WHEREAS, Alvin Murphy is one such exemplary person, who is a Unicoi County
recipient of the Governor's Volunteer Stars Award in recognition of his laudable commitment to
his community; and
WHEREAS, in the disorienting aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Southside Baptist Church
functioned as a nexus of emergency services in the community, and Mr. Murphy, realizing the
need for a central figure to coordinate these efforts, volunteered his time and labor there to
ensure an efficient recovery for his community; and
WHEREAS, to provide his undivided attention to this pressing need, he took off time
from his work as an orthopedic physician assistant, and he dedicated his days to noting where
essentials were lacking and facilitating supply runs; and
WHEREAS, many of his fellow citizens were empowered to quickly rebuild and restore
their lives and meet their necessities due to Mr. Murphy's superlative leadership and
compassion; and
