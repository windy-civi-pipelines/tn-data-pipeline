HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 177
By Powers
A RESOLUTION to urge the naming of the Blue Springs Boat
Ramp in Speedwell in honor of U.S. Army Staff
Sergeant Terry William Prater.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal safety and concerns to ensure our individual and collective freedom, and the Volunteer
State is especially proud to be the home of so many valiant men and women who have
performed above and beyond the call of duty; and
WHEREAS, the citizens of Tennessee have, throughout the years, been called upon to
take up arms against the enemies of this great nation, risking their lives and leaving their loved
ones behind to honorably safeguard the freedoms and liberties guaranteed to all citizens of
these United States and vanquishing those who threaten our way of life; and
WHEREAS, one such individual was U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Terry William Prater, who
made the ultimate sacrifice for his country in the line of duty when he was killed in Iraq on March
15, 2007, at the age of twenty-five; and
WHEREAS, Staff Sergeant Terry Prater died along with four other soldiers when their
vehicle struck an explosive; they were assigned to the 1st Squadron, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 2nd
Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, Texas. Staff Sergeant Prater was on
his second deployment in Iraq; and
WHEREAS, the son of Cheryl Hurley and Terry Darrell Prater, Terry Prater was born in
Kentucky on August 13, 1981; he grew up in Floyd County, Kentucky, before moving with his
mother to Claiborne County, where he graduated from Powell Valley High School in 1999; and

WHEREAS, Staff Sergeant Prater hunted deer and turkey, but his true love was fishing;
he was a member of Centex Bass Hunters and especially enjoyed fishing off of the Blue Springs
Boat Ramp at Norris Lake; and
WHEREAS, Staff Sergeant Terry Prater was awarded a Purple Heart, and he received
the Silver Star from the President of the United States of America on August 5, 2004, for
conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Team Leader for RED Platoon,
Company C, 1st Battalion, 153rd Infantry Regiment, Task Force 1-9 Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division,
during combat operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom; and
WHEREAS, the heroism for which he was honored took place on August 4, 2004, when
he saved the life of Retired Sergeant Tim Ngo; Staff Sergeant Prater used his body to shield
Sergeant Ngo, whose skull had been shattered, from a grenade in a series of explosions in
Baghdad, Iraq; and
WHEREAS, in a show of gratitude and respect, Retired Sergeant Tim Ngo flew from
Minnesota to Speedwell to attend the celebration of life ceremony for Staff Sergeant Terry
Prater on March 26, 2007; also in attendance were members of Staff Sergeant Prater's family,
including his wife, Amy; his children, Bryson and Madisen; and his brother, who was stationed in

WHEREAS, still today, Staff Sergeant Prater's son, Bryson Prater, launches his boat and
fishes from the Blue Springs Boat Ramp that his father loved so well and called his favorite
"fishing hole"; and

history of our State and nation, the distinguished military service of every proud Tennessean
should be illuminated, shared, and properly honored; and
WHEREAS, Staff Sergeant Terry Prater of Claiborne County displayed unflinching
heroism and made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, and it would be most fitting to honor
his legacy at the place where he made some of his best memories; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
