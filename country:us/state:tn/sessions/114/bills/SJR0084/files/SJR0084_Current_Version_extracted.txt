A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Leadership Preparatory
Charter School upon its receipt of the 2024
Charter Champion Award for School of the Year.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we pay tribute to those educational institutions that, through
the natural talents and unflagging commitment to academic excellence evidenced by their
administration, faculty, staff, and students, have proven themselves to be among the best
schools in the State; and

institution, which was recently recognized by the Tennessee Charter School Center as the
recipient of the 2024 Charter Champion Award for School of the Year; and
WHEREAS, this prestigious award is given to a public charter school that offers an
excellent example of utilizing the flexibility and innovative nature of a charter school model to
innovate and have a significant positive impact on students; and
WHEREAS, founded in 2015 and led by Valissia Allen, Leadership Preparatory Charter
School has established itself as one of Tennessee's most successful schools for economically
disadvantaged (ED) students; the school serves over 400 students, the majority of whom come
from historically underserved low-income backgrounds yet consistently perform at levels far
above the State average; and
WHEREAS, Leadership Preparatory Charter School has evolved into a data-driven
institution that continually adjusts its approach to meet students' needs; and

WHEREAS, the strategies employed to support this student success were highlighted in
a case study from the Tennessee Charter School Center, offering access to best practices that
can be employed in any school; and

School have built an environment that ensures students have the very best atmosphere for
learning; and
