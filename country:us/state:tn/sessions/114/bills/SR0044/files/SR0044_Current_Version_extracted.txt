SENATE RESOLUTION 44
By Rose
A RESOLUTION to honor Zelma Hall on the occasion of her 108th
birthday.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we pay tribute to those citizens who are celebrating special
occasions in their estimable lives; and
WHEREAS, Zelma Hall celebrates her 108th birthday on March 18, 2025, a milestone
that commemorated as yet another precious souvenir of life's rich pageant; and
WHEREAS, a living monument to the courage and ardor of our country's history, Ms.
Hall is the oldest living woman World War II veteran in Tennessee, and her service in the U.S.
Army at Aberdeen Proving Grounds in Maryland, where she constructed beds for pilots, was a
hidden but crucial component to the war effort; and
WHEREAS, not wishing to rest upon her laurels, Ms. Hall returned from her wartime
endeavors to become a cosmetologist, and wishing to serve her fellow citizens in a deeper
capacity, she earned her nursing license thereafter; and
WHEREAS, her boundless charity and generosity led her to foster over 500 children in
her lifetime, a labor of love that will echo throughout the lives of countless individuals for years
to come; and
WHEREAS, as she enters her 108th year, Ms. Hall is still a positive force for good,
admired for her wisdom, spirit of generosity, integrity, and enthusiasm for life; and
WHEREAS, we wish to grasp this golden opportunity to specially recognize one of
Tennessee's most outstanding citizens on this very special occasion; now, therefore,
