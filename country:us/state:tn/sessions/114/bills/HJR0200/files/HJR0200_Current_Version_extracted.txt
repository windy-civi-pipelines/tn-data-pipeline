HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 200
By Farmer
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Misti DeGroot on her
selection as the 2024-2025 Sevier County
School System Grades 5-8 Teacher of the Year.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should pause to
specially recognize those outstanding teachers who have devoted their careers to providing the
highest-quality education for Tennessee's students; and
WHEREAS, Misti DeGroot is one such estimable educator, who has distinguished
herself as a professional of the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity; and
WHEREAS, Ms. DeGroot has been selected as the 2024-2025 Sevier County School
System Grades 5-8 Teacher of the Year, a most befitting honor that recognizes the positive
influence she has on so many young lives; and
WHEREAS, a math teacher at Northview Junior Academy, Misti DeGroot has taught for
three years; she is an extremely talented and compassionate educator who works assiduously
to motivate her students to reach their full potential, both as scholars and as citizens; and
WHEREAS, tirelessly working to imagine new avenues for education, Ms. DeGroot
created a "Math Madness" program, inspired by the March Madness basketball tournament
season, that involved the entire eighth grade and ingeniously incorporated a healthy competitive
spirit into her mathematics curriculum, instilling in her students a fresh enthusiasm for learning;
and
WHEREAS, a model servant-leader, Ms. DeGroot is always willing to sacrifice her
personal time to give extra assistance to a struggling student and to attend her students' athletic
undertakings; she has dedicated herself to addressing the whole personhood of her students,
rather than attempting to isolate their academic value; and
