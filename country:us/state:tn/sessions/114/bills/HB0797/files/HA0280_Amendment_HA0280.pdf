SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 37, Chapter 1, Part 1, is amended by
adding the following as a new section:
(a) As used in this section, "approved detention facility" means a detention
facility used for detention of juveniles, including a detention home or center for
delinquent children that is under the control, direction, or supervision of the court or other
public authority or private agency approved by the court. Any such detention center and
operator must be approved, certified, or licensed by the department of children's
services.
(b) In a county that has provided an approved detention facility to meet the
needs for care of children under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or detained by order
of the juvenile court pending an investigation or hearing and disposition, the juvenile
court is required to use and assume direct supervision, control, and direction of the
approved detention facility as the primary detention facility for detention of juveniles
under the court's jurisdiction or arrange with a licensed institution, agency, or the
department of children's services to manage the facility or to receive temporary care and
custody of children within the jurisdiction of the court.
(c) Consistent with the public purposes set forth in ยง 37-1-101, if a county has

courtroom, then the juvenile court must use the dedicated courtroom for conducting any

detention facility, as long as the courtroom substantially complies with the administrative
office of the courts' minimum courtroom security requirements. It is the purpose of this
section to minimize the humiliation of a child in custody or detention from public
exposure and the use of restraints that may occur from unnecessary vehicular
transportation of the child. This section does not replace the provisions in the
Tennessee Rules of Juvenile Procedure pertaining to confidentiality of proceedings and
the use of contemporaneous audio-visual transmissions.
(d) This section applies only to counties having a population of more than three
hundred sixty-six thousand two hundred (366,200) according to the 2020 federal census
or any subsequent federal census.
SECTION 2. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
