Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 298
By Harris
A RESOLUTION to celebrate AARP Tennessee Day.
WHEREAS, in furtherance of its mission to empower Tennesseans fifty-plus years old to
choose how they live as they age, AARP advocates for its members on critical priorities, such
as strengthening caregiving, protecting seniors from fraud, and ensuring all Americans have
independence and choice as they age, serving as a one-stop resource for information on the
fifty-plus population of Tennessee and offering programs and tools that help Tennesseans make
the best decisions about their health and financial security; and
WHEREAS, in addition to providing information for its members, AARP of Tennessee
has fought for the passage of legislation protecting its 670,000 members, including the creation
of the Tennessee Department of Disability and Aging; and
WHEREAS, most of AARP's members want to stay in their own homes and communities
for as long as possible, and to that end, AARP helps cities, towns, and counties become great
places for all ages, through its Network of Age Friendly States and Communities; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we celebrate March 18, 2025, as AARP Tennessee Day at the Capitol and
extend our best wishes for continued success in AARP's very important mission.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation to AARP Tennessee State Director Mia D. McNeil, Esquire.
