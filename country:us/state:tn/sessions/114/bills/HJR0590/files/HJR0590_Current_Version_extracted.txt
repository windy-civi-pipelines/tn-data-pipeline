HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 590
By Keisling
A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Jaden Evans on
winning the TSSAA girls' wrestling championship
in the 120-pound weight class.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, Jaden Evans, a senior at Alvin C. York Institute, has won the 2025 TSSAA
girls' wrestling championship in the 120-pound weight class; and
WHEREAS, she is now a back-to-back state champion, as she won the 2024 title in the
107-pound class; and
WHEREAS, this gifted athlete won six varsity tournaments and was undefeated as she
entered post-season competition; and
WHEREAS, Jaden Evans placed second in the sectional round, losing only by points to
last year's state champion in the 120-pound weight class; and
WHEREAS, entering the state championship meet, Jaden faced a tough road to achieve
ultimate victory, as each of her potential opponents was a returning state medalist; and
WHEREAS, in her first match, she pinned her opponent in 1:50 and then won her
second match by major decision, 13-4; and
WHEREAS, in the third round, she pinned her opponent with only thirty seconds
remaining in the match; and
WHEREAS, in the final match of the meet, Jaden Evans faced off against the rival who
was responsible for her sole defeat of the season; the foes were tied 1-1 with mere seconds

remaining when Jaden locked her opponent in an arm bar, forced her onto her back, and
completed the pin at 5:43 to win the state championship and bring home the gold; and
WHEREAS, Jaden Evans epitomizes all that is good in today's student athlete, as she
has achieved a high level of success in athletic competition while demonstrating great character
both on and off the wrestling mat; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting for us to salute this elite athlete for her back-to-back state
championships in different weight classes; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and congratulate Jaden Evans on winning the 2025 TSSAA girls'
