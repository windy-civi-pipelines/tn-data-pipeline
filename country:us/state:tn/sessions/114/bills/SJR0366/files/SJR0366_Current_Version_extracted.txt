Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 366
By Pody
A RESOLUTION to honor the life and ministry of Brother Ronnie
Smith.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of the General Assembly should honor those
individuals who have answered a divine call to the ministry and who have served with
dedication, vigor, and enthusiasm to perform God's work for their congregations and their
communities; and
WHEREAS, one such dedicated church leader is Brother Ronnie Smith, who has served
his community and congregation well for the past several decades; and
WHEREAS, born on March 7, 1946, to Homer O. and Attie Chillon Nixon Smith, Brother
Smith first felt the call to ministry as a junior in high school when he was attending Beechmont
Baptist Church in Kentucky, and after being licensed by Beechmont Baptist Church and
ordained by First Baptist Church in Watertown, he began his first pastorate at Whorton Springs
Baptist Church in 1968; and
WHEREAS, once he completed his pastorates at Whorton Springs Baptist Church,
Hurricane Baptist Church, and Bellwood Baptist Church, Brother Smith shifted away from full-
time ministry from 1978 to 1987, but always ready to utilize his God-given gifts to guard the fold,
he faithfully served the people of God at Upper Helton Baptist Church, Cedar Grove Baptist
Church, and Linwood Baptist Church as interim pastor in their times of need; and
WHEREAS, Brother Smith returned to full-time ministry to serve Hurricane Baptist
Church and New Hope Baptist Church, congregations that he moved between from 1987
onward, and as the currently acting pastor of Hurricane Baptist Church, he continues to pour
himself out for the sake of his flock, edifying those under his care with his ever-present concern
and Christ-like compassion; and

Spanish teacher for forty-five years, educating at Woodbury High School, Mount Juliet Middle

University with a Bachelor of Science degree and master's degree, and he later received a
doctorate degree through extension courses at Lake Charles Bible College; and
WHEREAS, helping ill students achieve the same academic rigor as the classroom,
Brother Smith worked in Wilson County as a homebound teacher from 1973 to 1985, and his
scholastic mastery and endless empathy enabled his pupils to consistently succeed; and
WHEREAS, Brother Smith's commitment to God, his spiritual leadership, and his love for
