(4) A person who was convicted prior to July 1, 2025, of an offense that
is eligible for expunction under subdivision (p)(1) may request the clerk of the
court in which the conviction occurred remove and destroy all public records of

(5) Automatic expunction pursuant to this subsection (p) must be done
without cost to the person.
