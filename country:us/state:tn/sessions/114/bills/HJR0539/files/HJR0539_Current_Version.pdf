HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 539
By Hale
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the T.B. Sutton General
Store on the occasion of its 100th anniversary.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should recognize those exemplary
Tennessee landmarks that have contributed to the enduring legacy of the Volunteer State; and
WHEREAS, one such historic establishment is the T.B. Sutton General Store of
Granville, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year; and
WHEREAS, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the T.B. Sutton General
Store has remained a cornerstone of life in Granville since the 1800s, retaining its original
charm with many interior features from the early twentieth century; and
WHEREAS, the patrons of T.B. Sutton General Store frequent the establishment for its
unique handmade items, nostalgic toys, Stetson hats, cookbooks, ice cream counter, and old-
fashioned candies, as well as the Granville Artisans' Gallery, which features crafted work from
ten local artisans; and
WHEREAS, each Saturday night, the T.B. Sutton General Store hosts Tennessee's best
bluegrass at the Sutton Ole Time Music Hour, giving the guests in attendance a truly
memorable experience; and
WHEREAS, the T.B. Sutton General Store has been recognized by Country Living and
Southern Living magazines for its appeal as a summer destination and as one of the South's
most charming country stores; and
WHEREAS, the T.B. Sutton General Store was purchased by Harold and Beverly Sutton
and gifted to the Museum in 2007 with two conditions: the store would continue to operate as a
country store and it would feature live bluegrass music; and
