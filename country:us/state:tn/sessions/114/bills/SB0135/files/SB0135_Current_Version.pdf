(4) The LEA shall inform the student's parent or guardian who provided
written authorization for the student to possess and self-administer rescue
seizure medication that the school and its employees and agents are not liable
as a result of any injury sustained by the student or another person from
possession or self-administration of the rescue seizure medication. The

school is not liable, and the parent or guardian must indemnify and hold harmless

not relieve liability of the school or its employees for willful or wanton misconduct.
(5) Unless subsequently rescinded in writing, the authorization is
effective for the entirety of the school year in which it is granted. The LEA may
suspend or revoke the student's possession and self-administration privileges if
the student misuses the rescue seizure medication or makes the rescue seizure
