SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 319
By Campbell
A RESOLUTION to honor and recognize Margot Ochiltree Webber
on the occasion of her first birthday.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should pay tribute to those citizens who are celebrating
special occasions in their young lives; and
WHEREAS, Margot Ochiltree Webber will celebrate her first birthday on July 30, 2025,
an exciting milestone that will mark a full year of happiness for her loving family; and
WHEREAS, born at 10:47 p.m. on July 30, 2024, at St. Francis Hospital, Margot was a
seven-pound, eight-ounce bundle of joy who forever changed the lives of those who welcomed
her for the better; and
WHEREAS, the beloved first daughter of Schyler Blake and Connor Aitken Webber,
Margot is the first child of her generation for both sides of her family; and
WHEREAS, Margot certainly brings sunshine to her parents and extended family; she is
the granddaughter of Dr. Heather and Dr. Angus Webber and Vicki Hicks Peterson; the great-
granddaughter of Dr. Bart and Audrey Campbell; and the niece of Blair Webber; and
WHEREAS, Margot has earned acclaim as the very definition of cuteness, and she is
already renowned within the family for her outstanding ability to communicate through a
seemingly boundless universe of facial expressions, the most memorable of which was her
expression upon trying strawberries for the first time; and
WHEREAS, Margot Ochiltree Webber is a joy to be around and a blessing to all who
have the good fortune of knowing her; and
WHEREAS, we wish to grasp this golden opportunity to specially recognize one of our
youngest citizens on this very special occasion; now, therefore,
