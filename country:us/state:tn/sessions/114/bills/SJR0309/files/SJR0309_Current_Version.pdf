SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 309
By Yager
A RESOLUTION to welcome Captain Barry "Butch" Wilmore and
Captain Sunita "Suni" Williams back to Earth
after completing their mission aboard the
International Space Station.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly take great pleasure in recognizing
two astronauts who served the disciplines of aeronautics and space flight with distinction and
demonstrated their devotion to their country and their mission during their more than nine-month
stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS); and
WHEREAS, after nearly 300 days in orbit, Captain Barry "Butch" Wilmore and Captain
Sunita "Suni" Williams, the astronauts who flew on Boeing's Starliner for its first crewed mission,
returned to Earth on March 18, 2025; and
WHEREAS, Captain Wilmore and Captain Williams arrived at the ISS in June 2024 for a
scheduled short stay as part of the Starliner's test flight; however, technical issues prevented
them from returning home on the spaceship; and
WHEREAS, NASA decided to keep them at the ISS for a few extra months to maintain
staffing levels, later launching the SpaceX Crew-9 mission with only two astronauts, instead of
the usual four, to provide Captain Wilmore and Captain Williams with a ride back home; and
WHEREAS, the average person would probably not relish spending more than nine
months in space, but these two veterans of space flight enjoyed their extra time in the cosmos,
modestly referring to their extended stay as "just part of the job"; and
WHEREAS, in the early morning of March 18, 2025, Captain Wilmore and Captain
Williams boarded the SpaceX Dragon at the ISS to return to Earth; after a seventeen-hour
voyage, the Dragon made a water landing off the Florida coast that evening; and

and has earned degrees from Tennessee Technological University and the University of
Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, selected as an astronaut by NASA in July 2000, Butch Wilmore is a retired
U.S. Navy captain and a veteran of two spaceflights; he has accumulated more than 8,000 flight
hours and 663 carrier landings; and
WHEREAS, Sunita Williams is also a retired U.S. Navy captain; selected by NASA as an
astronaut in 1998, she has completed two space missions and logged over 3,000 flight hours in
more than thirty different aircrafts; and
WHEREAS, Captain Wilmore and Captain Williams are to be greatly commended for
their dedication to duty in the face of adversity; these two astronauts served an extended stay in
space without complaint or compunction, and they are worthy of our approbation upon their
return home; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we welcome Captain Barry "Butch" Wilmore and
