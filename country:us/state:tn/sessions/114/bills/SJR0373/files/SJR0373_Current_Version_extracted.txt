Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 373
By Pody
A RESOLUTION to recognize Hurricane Baptist Church on the
occasion of its 210th anniversary.
WHEREAS, the churches of our nation have been an integral part of our history as a
people and have had an unparalleled impact in forming and maintaining a stable and just
society; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we should recognize those venerable religious
institutions and their congregations who, through their unflagging capacity for love, dedication of
spirit, and faith in God, strive to enrich the lives of people in their communities; and
WHEREAS, one such dynamic community of faith is Hurricane Baptist Church in Wilson
County, whose members are celebrating the church's 210th anniversary this year; and
WHEREAS, the origins of Hurricane Baptist Church trace back to August 1815, when
the church was constituted as Union Church with twenty-six founding members living in what is
now known as the Hurricane community; and
WHEREAS, the church's first pastor, Joshua Lester, was born in Virginia on September
6, 1781, and became an ordained minister at the age of twenty; after settling in Wilson County
in 1805, he played a crucial role in the establishment of Union Church, which he served as
pastor from 1815 to 1822; and
WHEREAS, the second pastor, John Bond, moved with his family from South Carolina to
Middle Tennessee in 1806 at the age of nineteen; an assistant to Joshua Lester, he was
ordained to preach at Union Church in 1822; and
WHEREAS, Pastor Bond donated eleven acres of land to the church and helped
construct a meeting house; he faithfully served the congregation for thirty-nine years until his
passing on March 2, 1861; and

WHEREAS, the third pastor, Nathaniel Morgan Green, was born in Wilson County and
raised in the Hurricane community; ordained in 1843, Elder Green began preaching at Union
Church after the death of John Bond and continued to serve for nineteen years, until his own
passing in 1880; and
WHEREAS, the church's name change from Union Church to Hurricane Baptist Church
in October 1923 reflects a deep connection to the history of the community, as a powerful
storm—likely a tornado, but referred to as a hurricane—once devastated the area a century
earlier; and
WHEREAS, the congregation has worshiped in three different buildings since its
founding: the original log meeting house of 1815, a two-story structure built in collaboration with
the Masons, and the current building, which was constructed in 1907; and
WHEREAS, Hurricane Baptist Church is currently under the faithful and capable
leadership of Pastor Kenneth M. Tramel; born in DeKalb County, he became an ordained
minister in 1963 and served from 1984 to 2011 as campus minister for Cumberland University,
where the Kenneth M. Tramel Baptist Student Center was named in his honor. Pastor Tramel
began preaching at Hurricane Baptist Church in March 2010 and continues to serve the
congregation to this day; and
WHEREAS, throughout its 210-year history, Hurricane Baptist Church has remained
steadfast in its mission of faith, service, and fellowship, making an indelible impact on its
members and the surrounding community; and
WHEREAS, Hurricane Baptist Church is truly one of the great religious institutions and
catalysts for positive spiritual change in our State and nation, and the members of this
exceptional congregation should be appropriately honored for their exemplary service to their
fellow Christians and the good people of Tennessee; now, therefore,
- 2 - 006825
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we join in the celebration of the 210th anniversary of
Hurricane Baptist Church, thank the good people of this historic congregation and their ministers
for their notable service to their Lord and the State of Tennessee, and wish them much
continued success and happiness.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
