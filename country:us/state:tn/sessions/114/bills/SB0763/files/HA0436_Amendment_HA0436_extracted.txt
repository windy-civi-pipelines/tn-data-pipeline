application for the vapor product to the FDA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 387j, and

(ii) Rescinded by the FDA; or

attractiveness to individuals who are under twenty-one (21) years of age
beyond general attractiveness for individuals who are at least twenty-one
(21) years of age.

can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to that end, the provisions of
this act are severable.

Section 8:
SECTION 10. Sections 1-6 and 8-9 of this act take effect July 1, 2025, the public
welfare requiring it. For purposes of promulgating rules, Section 7 of this act takes effect upon
