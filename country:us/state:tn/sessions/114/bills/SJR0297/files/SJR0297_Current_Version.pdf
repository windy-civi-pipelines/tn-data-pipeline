Convention, where the Tennessee Department of Agriculture and the Tennessee Association of
Fairs presented awards to the top county, regional, and State agricultural fairs for the 2024
season; and
WHEREAS, the 2024 White County Fair greatly benefited from the stalwart leadership
and vision of the White County Fair Board, including President Mike Wilson, Vice President Paul
Flatt, Secretary Sara Farris, and Treasurer Albert R. Dicus; and
