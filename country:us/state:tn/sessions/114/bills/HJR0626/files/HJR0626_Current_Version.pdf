HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 626
By Vital
A RESOLUTION to urge the appointment of highly qualified
individuals to the board of directors of the
Tennessee Valley Authority who understand the
growing energy needs of Tennessee and the
importance of reliable, affordable power for the
State's economic future.
WHEREAS, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is the largest public power provider in
the United States, serving 153 local power company partners who then provide energy to more
than ten million people across seven states, including a substantial majority of Tennessee's
homes, businesses, industries, and farms; and
WHEREAS, TVA was created to deliver reliable and affordable electricity, foster
economic development, and manage the natural resources of the Tennessee Valley, all of
which remain critical to the region's quality of life and economic competitiveness; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee and the broader TVA service area are experiencing historic
levels of growth, placing new demands on energy generation, transmission, and delivery
infrastructure; and
WHEREAS, meeting these needs will require sustained investments in new generating
capacity, a forward-looking and customer-focused energy strategy, and a continued focus on
reliability and affordability; and
WHEREAS, the TVA board of directors plays a central role in guiding the direction of the
Authority by setting policies and priorities related to generation planning, power supply, rates,
and long-term capital investment; and
WHEREAS, five current vacancies on the TVA board present a timely and significant
opportunity to appoint individuals who are well-prepared to meet the moment and lead TVA into
its next chapter of service; and

WHEREAS, individuals appointed to the board should bring deep experience in the
electric power industry, sound business judgment, and a clear understanding of TVA's unique
mission; and
WHEREAS, TVA's 153 local power company customers—including electric
cooperatives—are essential to meeting this challenge, working every day to deliver power to the
homes and businesses that rely on them; and
WHEREAS, serious consideration should be given to leaders leading electric
cooperatives or other local power companies who possess real-world knowledge of the region's
energy needs and a strong commitment to delivering value to the ratepayers they serve; and
WHEREAS, TVA will benefit from board members who possess firsthand knowledge of
the daily challenges and responsibilities of delivering power twenty-four hours a day, seven
days a week, 365 days a year and who understand the critical link between robust power supply
and economic development throughout the Tennessee Valley; and
WHEREAS, the governance structure of cooperatively owned generation and
transmission utilities (G&Ts) serves as a relevant model for TVA, where 100 percent of the
board members of a G&T are customers of the utility, who are also the only owners, ensuring
strong customer-focused leadership and accountability; and
WHEREAS, representation of rural and suburban Tennesseans—who depend on TVA
for power and opportunity—should be a meaningful factor in the selection of new board
members, ensuring that the diverse needs of the entire Tennessee Valley are reflected in TVA's
leadership; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we respectfully urge the President of the United States to appoint
individuals to the Tennessee Valley Authority board of directors who possess proven experience

in the electric utility industry, infrastructure development, or utility governance, particularly those
whose experience comes through service at one of the 153 local power company customers;
understand the energy demands of the Tennessee Valley and the importance of adequate
generation to meet those needs; are committed to the principles of affordable, reliable power for
all ratepayers; recognize that robust power supply is essential to economic growth and job
creation; and bring voices and perspectives from rural and suburban Tennessee and local
power companies to the board's deliberations.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this General Assembly calls for filling the existing
vacancies on the TVA board of directors with individuals who will uphold TVA's mission and
help position the Authority to meet the future with strength and purpose.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that certified copies of this resolution be transmitted to
the President of the United States and each member of Tennessee's congressional delegation.
