SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 40-35-302, is amended by adding
the following as a new subsection:
( )
(1) In addition to any other sentence authorized by this section, a person
convicted of a Class A misdemeanor in general sessions court shall be required
to complete a cognitive behavioral training course unless the court deems such a
requirement to be inappropriate. If incarceration is part of the person's sentence,
then the cognitive behavioral training course must be completed after the period
of incarceration is completed.
(2) The offender must pay the cost of the course and, regardless of
whether the defendant is indigent, the county is not required to pay the cost of
the course.
(3) The offender must provide proof of course completion to the court or
the court's designee within the time period specified by the court. An offender
who willfully fails to complete the course or to provide proof of completion within
the specified time period is in contempt of court and may be punished by
confinement of up to ten (10) days.
(4) A cognitive behavioral training course used to fulfill the requirement in
this subsection ( ) must:
