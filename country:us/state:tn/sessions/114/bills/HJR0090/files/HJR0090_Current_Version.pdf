HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 90
By Boyd
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Melanie R. Bean for her
honorable and astute service to the people of
Tennessee as the 2024–2025 president of the
Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should salute those
citizens who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as community
leaders of whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy individual is Melanie R. Bean of Lebanon, who is the
2024–2025 president of the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (TACDL); and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers was formed and
chartered in 1973, making it the oldest legal defense bar association in the State; TACDL
provides education, training, and support to criminal defense lawyers and advocates for fair and
effective criminal justice in the courts and wherever justice demands; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Bean entered the world of criminal defense in 1998 when she served as
a law clerk for the Honorable Frank Lannom, whom she later joined in practice, and she has
been a member of TACDL for over twenty years; and
WHEREAS, no stranger to leadership, she has served two times on the TACDL Board of
Directors, a testament to her consistent devotion and the respect she has earned from her
peers; and
WHEREAS, a former legislative committee chair, Ms. Bean has regularly represented
TACDL in their legislative aims, including collaborating with legislators on policy development
and providing testimony to various committees in the legislature; and

WHEREAS, Ms. Bean is equally active and influential outside of TACDL; she currently
serves as an appointed member of the Domestic Violence State Coordinating Counsel and
previously served as an appointed hearing committee member for the Tennessee Board of
Professional Responsibility from 2011 to 2017; and
WHEREAS, thanks to her superlative work and skill, she has rightfully accrued several
recognitions and honors, including the Workhouse Award and Rob W. Ritchie Award, both from
TACDL, as well as the Distinguished Alumni Award from Cumberland University; and
WHEREAS, apart from her work as a partner of Lannom and Williams, PLLC, Ms. Bean
helps to maintain her family's farm in Clay County on which she grew up; although she still
maintains a great love for her roots in Clay County, she now resides in Lebanon, where she is a
church member of The Bridge Fellowship; and
WHEREAS, her remarkable success in and outside of the courtroom stems from her
dedication to safeguarding basic human dignity and to serving others with her legal talents and
community involvement; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Bean has demonstrated the utmost professionalism, ability, and
integrity as an attorney and civic leader, winning the unbridled respect and admiration of
members of the bar and bench and her community alike; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend Melanie R. Bean for her meritorious service to the
people of Tennessee as the 2024–2025 president of the Tennessee Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers and extend to her our best wishes for every future success.
