received language assistance services in the classroom during the school year
must be allowed to receive the same language assistance services while taking a
TCAP test or an end-of-course assessment, required by the state board of
education under subsection (a), as long as the receipt of language assistance
services does not invalidate the assessment.
(B) As used in this subdivision (j)(2), "language assistance services"
means services:
(i) Designed for speakers of languages other than English that
are provided pursuant to an individual learning plan (ILP) by a teacher
with an English as a second language endorsement to ELL students; or

accommodations and scaffolding pursuant to an ELL student's ILP that
are provided by a general education teacher in the general education
classroom to ELL students whose parent or guardian has waived the
student's receipt of the services described in subdivision (j)(2)(B)(i).
