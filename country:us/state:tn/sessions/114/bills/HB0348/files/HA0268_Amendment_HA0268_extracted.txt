SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-3-314(c), is amended by adding
the following as a new subdivision:
(5)
(A) Notwithstanding another law to the contrary, for fiscal year 2025-2026
and each subsequent fiscal year, if a local government adopts a budget that
includes the maintenance of local funding effort required under this section but
fails to appropriate or allocate the full amount budgeted to the LEA, then the local
government shall first appropriate and allocate the unfunded portion to the LEA
before it may increase its maintenance of funding effort for any of the following:
(i) The county mayor's office, pursuant to § 5-9-408;
(ii) The sheriff's office, pursuant to § 8-20-120;
(iii) The highway department, pursuant to § 67-3-901(d); or
(iv) The election commission, pursuant to § 2-12-209.
(B) Funds appropriated under subdivision (c)(5)(A) to correct a local

year following a year in which the local government failed to appropriate or
allocate the full budgeted amount to the LEA is determined based on the amount
budgeted for the previous fiscal year, rather than the amount actually
appropriated or allocated.
