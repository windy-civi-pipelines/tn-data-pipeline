SECTION 1. Chapter 176 of the Private Acts of 1953, as amended by Chapter 524 of
the Private Acts of 1953, Chapter 95 of the Private Acts of 1985, Chapter 56 of the Private Acts
of 1991, Chapter 7 of the Private Acts of 2015, and Chapter 42 of the Private Acts of 2024, and

SECTION 3. The Hospital District shall be operated and controlled by a board of
trustees consisting of no less than three (3) and no more than seven (7) persons
appointed by the Henry County Commission. Two (2) of the trustees shall be members
of the Henry County Commission, and the remainder shall be citizens of Henry County
at large. Trustees shall serve for terms of four (4) years, staggered such that no more
than two (2) terms expire in any single year.
All trustees holding office on the effective date of this Act shall continue to serve
until their office becomes vacant (due to term expiration or otherwise). The Henry
County Commission may recall any trustee with or without cause. When a trustee's term
expires or an office becomes vacant, if it is necessary to maintain the minimum required
number of trustees, the Henry County Commission shall appoint a successor trustee
within ninety (90) days of the vacancy. If the expiration of a term or vacancy does not
result in fewer than the minimum number of required trustees, the Henry County
Commission may, in its discretion, appoint a successor trustee.
