Section 2:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 68, is amended by adding the following
as a new chapter:
68-107-101. Short title.
This act is known and may be cited as the "Women's Safety and Protection Act."
68-107-102. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is:
(1) To clarify and reconcile the meaning of sex, male, female, and related
terms in state law; and
(2) To provide protections for women and girls against sexual assault,
harassment, and violence in correctional facilities, juvenile detention facilities,
public higher educational institutions, and domestic violence shelters or where
women have been traditionally afforded safety and protection from acts of abuse
committed by men.
68-107-103. Findings.
The legislature finds and declares that:
(1) "Physical differences between men and women, however, are
enduring: '[T]he two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of
one [sex] is different from a community composed of both.'" United States v.
Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996), citing Ballard v. United States, 329 U.S. 187,
193 (1946);

- 1 -
(2) The United States supreme court has recognized that there are
"'[i]nherent differences' between men and women", and that these differences
"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either
sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity" in United States v.
Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996);
(3) The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States of America allows for legislatures to enact
facially neutral laws of general applicability, such as biologically based definitions
of sex;
(4) Biologically based definitions of sex have been consistently applied
since our nation's founding; and
(5) Decades of opinions from the supreme court of the United States
have upheld the argument that biological distinctions between male and female
are a matter of scientific fact, and sex is an objectively defined category that has
obvious, immutable, and distinguishable characteristics.
