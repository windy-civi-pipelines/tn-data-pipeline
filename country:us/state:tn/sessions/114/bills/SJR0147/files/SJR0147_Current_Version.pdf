performed above and beyond the call of duty; and

Stout, Larry Taylor, and James Gardener to George S. Gillespie, Jr., George Jordan, and
Harrison Collins, the first Tennessean to be awarded the Medal of Honor, the warrior ethos and
tenacity of the Volunteer is remembered; this M1 Abrams crew has demonstrated that the long-
time warrior ethos of the Tennessee Volunteer remains alive and well in Tennessee today; and
WHEREAS, this recent victory reflects not only the dedication, tenacity, and teamwork of
Staff Sergeant Riddick, Sergeant Owen, Specialist Eddings, and Specialist Carter but also the
excellence of the officer and non-commissioned officer leadership of the 278th ACR and the
Tennessee Army National Guard, as well as those who provide administrative, maintenance,
and supply support; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we recognize the brave and noble members of the
278th Armored Cavalry Regiment, as they have made untold and innumerable personal
sacrifices to be living examples of the Regiment's motto, "I Volunteer, Sir," to preserve the
liberties we enjoy today, and to bring great pride to the State of Tennessee through their recent
victory; now, therefore,
