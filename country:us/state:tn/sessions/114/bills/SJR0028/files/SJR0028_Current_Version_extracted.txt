Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 28
By Lowe
A RESOLUTION to express support for the Constitutional
Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of the 119th
U.S. Congress.
WHEREAS, the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 38) has been
introduced in the 119th U.S. Congress with more than 120 co-sponsors; and
WHEREAS, this bipartisan legislation would provide nationwide reciprocity for concealed
carry license holders and for residents of Constitutional Carry states; and
WHEREAS, the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act allows an individual with
a state-issued concealed carry license or permit to conceal a handgun in any other state and
also allows a resident of a Constitutional Carry state to carry in other states; and
WHEREAS, as the sponsors of the legislation have noted, the fundamental right to bear
arms and defend oneself should not be determined by the state in which one lives, nor do an
American citizen's Second Amendment rights disappear when he or she crosses a state line;
and
WHEREAS, to protect these fundamental rights, the Constitutional Concealed Carry
Reciprocity Act will protect law-abiding citizens' rights to conceal carry and travel freely between
states without worrying about conflicting state codes or onerous civil lawsuits; and
WHEREAS, currently, all fifty states issue concealed carry permits, forty-nine states
allow nonresident carry, and twenty-nine states have Constitutional Carry; thus, it makes
common sense for Congress to ensure that each state's concealed carry permit or license is
valid in every other state; and
WHEREAS, the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act is supported by many
major pro-Second Amendment organizations; and

WHEREAS, the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act passed the U.S. House
of Representatives in 2017 with bipartisan support; and
WHEREAS, President Donald Trump has committed to signing national concealed carry
reciprocity legislation into law; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that this General Assembly expresses its support for the
Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act pending in the 119th U.S. Congress and urge
passage of this landmark legislation that will protect the Second Amendment rights of
Tennessee's law-abiding citizens.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a certified copy of this resolution be transmitted to
the President and the Secretary of the U.S. Senate, the Speaker and the Clerk of the U.S.
House of Representatives, and each member of Tennessee's delegation to the U.S. Congress.
