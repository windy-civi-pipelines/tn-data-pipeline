highest quality education for Tennessee's students; and
WHEREAS, Adrian Maclin is one such estimable educator, who has distinguished
himself as a professional of the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity; and

recently named the 2025 Grammy Music Educator of the Year, an honor most befitting his
devotion to his students and his profession; and

from an original pool of more than 2,400 candidates; and

educators who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the field of music education
and who demonstrate a commitment to the broader cause of maintaining music education in the
schools; and

during the CBS Mornings show; his Grammy prize includes a $10,000 honorarium and a
matching $10,000 for his school's music program; and
WHEREAS, currently in his ninth year as Director of Choirs at Cordova High School,
Adrian Maclin has built an elite music program at the school, with his concert singers winning so
