HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 328
By Grills
A RESOLUTION to honor and recognize Holden Farms upon its
receipt of the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association's
Family Farm Environmental Excellence Award.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly salute that most noble agricultural
institution, the family farm, which serves as a cornerstone for our rural communities while
providing food and fiber for Tennessee and beyond; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy family farm is Holden Farms in Obion County, which,
after nomination by the Tennessee Poultry Association, is one of only three farms across the
United States selected to receive the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association's (USPOULTRY) Family
Farm Environmental Excellence Award; and
WHEREAS, this prestigious award was presented to the Holden family by Bill Griffith,
chief operations officer for Peco Foods and USPOULTRY vice chair, during the 2025
International Production and Processing Expo in Atlanta, Georgia; and
WHEREAS, Holden Farms is a fifth-generation, family-operated farm that is managed by
Kris and Rebecca Holden along with their sons, Hunter and Hayden; and
WHEREAS, USPOULTRY sponsors the annual awards for exemplary environmental
stewardship by family farmers engaged in poultry and egg production; applicants are rated in
several categories: nutrient management planning, implementation of novel sustainability
practices, community involvement, innovative litter or manure management techniques, and
participation in education or outreach programs; and
WHEREAS, in evaluating the farms, a team of environmental professionals from
universities, regulatory agencies, and state poultry associations review applications and conduct
farm visits; and
WHEREAS, the Holden family manages 2,085 acres of crops and includes Holden
Barns Partnership, a six-house poultry operation that was added to the farm in 2022; and

WHEREAS, adding the poultry barns has allowed Holden Farms to reduce its reliance
on commercial fertilizers; the litter generated on the farm is used as an organic fertilizer and
applied on the acres managed by the Holdens following an extensive and highly effective
nutrient management plan; and
WHEREAS, the use of poultry litter has led to substantial improvements in both crop
yield and soil health, with micronutrients like copper, sulfur, zinc, and magnesium showing
steady increases; Holden Farms applies poultry litter strategically, often before wheat planting,
allowing for incorporation into the soil during the sowing process; and
WHEREAS, the Holden family is also dedicated to preserving natural habitats and
promoting biodiversity on their farms through the maintenance of several acres of woodlands
and buffer zones; these areas serve as vital habitats for native wildlife, ensuring that local
species continue to thrive alongside agricultural operations; and
WHEREAS, wildlife plots are carefully planted and maintained to provide a reliable food
source for animals during the colder months; in addition, the Holden family manages numerous
ponds across their property, which serve dual purposesâ€”controlling runoff and providing a
consistent water source for wildlife during dry periods; and
WHEREAS, despite the challenges fence rows can pose to crops, the family has made
the intentional decision to preserve them; these areas support mature hardwood trees, which
provide essential habitats for wildlife and contribute to environmental health by producing
oxygen; and
WHEREAS, Holden Farms currently maintains five Century Farms, which is a program
that honors family farmers who have kept continuously owned family land in agricultural
production for at least the last 100 years; three more of the farms the Holden family operates
will achieve Century Farm status this year; and
WHEREAS, this General Assembly finds it appropriate to acknowledge and applaud the
members of the Holden family for their dedication to agriculture, recognizing the importance of
the family farm to our rural communities and the State of Tennessee; now, therefore,
- 2 - 004443

FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE

wishes for every continued success.

for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
