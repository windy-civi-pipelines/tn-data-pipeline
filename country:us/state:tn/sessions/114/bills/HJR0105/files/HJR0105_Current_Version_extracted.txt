A RESOLUTION to honor and congratulate Joseph Hauskin on

others; and
WHEREAS, each year, 1.3 million Tennessee volunteers give over 99 million hours of
community service, contributing $2.6 billion to Tennessee's economy; and
WHEREAS, these volunteers are the backbone of our communities, and by donating
their time and talents to fulfill needs that would otherwise go unmet, they embody the spirit of
giving; and

recipient of the Governor's Volunteer Stars Award in recognition of his laudable commitment to
his community; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Hauskin has served his community by inventing the StoneRookLock

corrections officer enabled him to recognize outdated lock systems and understaffed facilities;

volunteerism epitomizes the spirit of the Volunteer State, and he should be specially recognized;
