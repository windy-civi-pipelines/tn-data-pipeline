Signature of Sponsor
by deleting all language after the enacting clause and substituting:

Section 2:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 8-21-401, is amended by deleting the

Section 3:
section in its entirety and substituting instead the following:
8-21-401.
(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, the filing fees and costs provided in this

Section 4:
section in civil cases are chargeable and must be collected at the time the services are
requested from the clerk or other officer of the court; however, this section does not limit
the ability of a party to initiate a judicial proceeding by filing a pauper's oath. If a party
requests services from the clerk but fails to pay the applicable filing fees at the time of
the request, then the clerk shall give notice to the party and counsel of record, if any, of
the party's non-compliance with this section within ten (10) business days. If the party
fails to correct the party's non-compliance within ten (10) business days of the date of
the notice of non-compliance, then the clerk may move the court for relief, up to and
including striking a filing or dismissing the judicial proceeding. If payment of the clerk's
filing fees or costs would create a substantial hardship for a party, then the court is
encouraged to use the discretion provided in Rule 29 of the Rules of the Supreme Court
to find that the party is indigent, even if that party does not meet the Legal Services
Corporation's poverty guidelines. If a party, other than a party who initiated a judicial
proceeding under a pauper's oath, pays filing fees or costs at the time the services are
requested, such payment must be deemed to satisfy the requirement for security to be
given for filing fees or costs, pursuant to § 20-12-120. An attorney filing the judicial

proceeding must have the option to sign a cost bond in lieu of the party paying the
clerk's filing fees or costs at the time services are requested. The clerk shall not refuse
to file a judicial proceeding where the attorney has opted to sign a cost bond. In any
judicial proceeding where the clerk refuses to accept such cost bond in lieu of the party
paying the clerk's filing fees or costs, the clerk forfeits all filing fees or costs in that
judicial proceeding. These requirements for filing fees or costs to be paid or security
provided when services are requested from the clerk do not apply in criminal cases. The
filing fees and costs listed in this section do not include officer's fees as provided for in §
8-21-901 and elsewhere. These filing fees and costs also do not include state and local
litigation taxes.

(2) The clerks of court shall charge a cost of ten dollars ($10.00) for each
requested continuance. Of this cost, the clerk shall deposit five dollars ($5.00)
into the county general fund to be used exclusively for the purposes of providing
security and enhancing the security of court facilities in the county. For each
- 8 - 005430
fiscal year, the court security committee, created by § 16-2-505(d)(2), shall
develop and submit recommendations to the county legislative body regarding
how such funds must be utilized. The clerk shall collect the costs for
continuances at the conclusion of the judicial proceeding. If multiple litigants
request a continuance, the judge may assess the costs to one (1) or more
parties.
(3) For receiving funds paid into the court's registry on confirmation of
private sales or other funds paid into the court's registry pursuant to court order,
and collecting and paying out the proceeds, the cost is fifty dollars ($50.00). This
cost also applies where there is a pre-judgment judicial attachment or similar
process to bring property into the court's possession prior to judgment. This cost
shall not apply to payments of proceeds made pursuant to court order to any
person from funds held by the clerk, except for court orders concerning a
redemption of delinquent taxes property sale; in such case, the fee must only be
charged one (1) time against the total amount of proceeds generated from the
sale of the property.
(4) The clerks have the authority to invest idle funds held under their
control, not otherwise invested. The clerk shall invest such funds in financial
institutions operating under the laws of the state or under the laws of the United
States; provided, that such deposits are insured under the federal deposit
insurance corporation. Such investments shall not exceed the amounts that are
federally insured, unless otherwise fully collateralized under a written collateral
agreement, or unless the funds are deposited with an institution that is a member
of the state collateral pool. The clerk may invest funds in the local government
investment pool administered by the state treasurer. The earnings on such
investments must become part of the costs of the clerk and the clerk shall
account for earnings received the same as with other costs received. As used in
- 9 - 005430
this subdivision (i)(4), "idle funds" means those funds the clerk holds pursuant to
statute, local rules of court, or a court order that does not specifically direct the
clerk to invest the funds. This subdivision (i)(4) does not relieve the clerks from
the responsibility of investing funds held under their control pursuant to court
order or local rules of court directing the clerk to invest funds, and the earnings
on those investments must accrue to the benefit of those directed by the court or
by agreement of the parties to the judicial proceeding.
(5) Whenever the clerk is required by law or by a court to send
documents by certified or registered mail, the clerk is entitled to recover the
clerk's actual costs for mailing the documents.
(6) For the purposes of determining the filing fees of the clerk, when any
party files a third-party complaint, counter-complaint, or cross-complaint, the
party filing the third-party complaint, counter-complaint, or cross-complaint must
be charged the same filing fee as was charged at the initiation of the original
judicial proceeding.
(j) Earmarked Funds for Technology. Out of all the standard filing fees charged
by the clerks of the courts, seven dollars ($7.00) of each standard filing fee must be
earmarked for technology and for other usual and necessary technology-related
expenses at the discretion of the clerk. The clerk shall preserve these funds exclusively
for these purposes and these funds shall not revert to the general fund at the end of a
budget year, if unexpended.
(k) Costs in Extraordinary Cases. In any extraordinary cases, the clerk may
petition the court to award reasonable costs, in excess of the amounts provided in this

Section 6:
section, to reimburse the clerk for the additional services demanded by the judicial
proceeding. In such judicial proceedings, the clerk may also petition the court to require
an appropriate cost bond. For the purposes of this subsection (k), an extraordinary case
means a case in which there are ten (10) or more parties.
- 10 - 005430
(l) Charges to the State Unchanged. Notwithstanding this section to the
contrary, any fees, costs, or commissions increased by this section that are assessed
against the state or that otherwise represent a charge to the state in criminal cases, child
support actions, mental health proceedings, judicial proceedings under the Tennessee
Adult Protection Act, compiled in title 71, chapter 6, part 1, judicial proceedings with
regard to child care licensing, and collection efforts brought by the department of human
services, are limited to the amounts chargeable prior to January 1, 2006.
(m) Indigent Parties. A clerk is not permitted to collect any filing fee or cost
authorized by this section without permitting any person the opportunity to institute a
judicial proceeding by means of a pauper's oath, in accordance with Rule 29 of the
Rules of the Supreme Court.
(n) Fees for Electronic Filing and Retrieval of Court Documents.
(1) In any court where electronic filing, signing, or verification of papers
has been authorized by local court rule and is in compliance with technological
standards established by the supreme court, clerks may assess a transaction fee
for each filing submitted by a party to the judicial proceeding. The transaction fee
is limited to a maximum of five dollars ($5.00) per filing up to a maximum of fifty
dollars ($50.00) per judicial proceeding. As an alternative to a transaction fee,
clerks may assess an annual subscription fee for each registered user of the
electronic filing system. The subscription fee permits the registered user
unlimited electronic filings for a one-year period. The one-year period must be
defined by the clerk and must be consistently maintained for all registered users
of the electronic filing system. The annual subscription fee shall not exceed
three hundred dollars ($300) for each annual period. Each of these fees must be
set in an amount necessary to defray the expenses associated with
implementation and maintenance of the electronic filing and document retrieval
- 11 - 005430
system and must be included in the local court rule authorizing it. Pursuant to
subsection (l), these fees shall not be assessed against the state.
(2) Pursuant to subsection (m), neither the transaction fee nor the
subscription fee must be assessed to a party declared indigent or to that indigent
party's legal representative.
(3) In any court where electronic filing, signing, or verification of papers
has been authorized by local court rule, the state and any department or
contractor of the state is not required to file documents electronically,
notwithstanding any local court rule.
(4) Neither the electronic filing transaction fee or subscription fee limit a
clerk's statutory authority to charge subscription fees or transaction fees for
obtaining copies of documents maintained by the clerk as part of an electronic
filing system of a separate document management system.
(o) Orders of Protection. Notwithstanding this section to the contrary, the clerks
of the courts shall collect filing fees, costs, litigation taxes, or any other costs associated
with the filing, issuance, registration, service, dismissal or nonsuit, appeal, or
enforcement of an ex parte order of protection, order of protection, or a petition for either
such order in the manner provided in § 36-3-617.
(p) Clerks' Report. The Tennessee state court clerks association must file a
report with the general assembly on or before December 31, 2028, proposing any
increases in the fees, costs, or commissions provided in this section; provided, however,
that this section does not prohibit any increases prior to December 31, 2028.

Raw Text:
Senate Judiciary 1
Amendment No. 1 to SB0409
Gardenhire
Signature of Sponsor
AMEND S e n ate Bill No. 409* House Bill No. 487
by deleting all language after the enacting clause and substituting:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 8-21-401, is amended by deleting the
section in its entirety and substituting instead the following:
8-21-401.
(a) Except as otherwise provided by law, the filing fees and costs provided in this
section in civil cases are chargeable and must be collected at the time the services are
requested from the clerk or other officer of the court; however, this section does not limit
the ability of a party to initiate a judicial proceeding by filing a pauper's oath. If a party
requests services from the clerk but fails to pay the applicable filing fees at the time of
the request, then the clerk shall give notice to the party and counsel of record, if any, of
the party's non-compliance with this section within ten (10) business days. If the party
fails to correct the party's non-compliance within ten (10) business days of the date of
the notice of non-compliance, then the clerk may move the court for relief, up to and
including striking a filing or dismissing the judicial proceeding. If payment of the clerk's
filing fees or costs would create a substantial hardship for a party, then the court is
encouraged to use the discretion provided in Rule 29 of the Rules of the Supreme Court
to find that the party is indigent, even if that party does not meet the Legal Services
Corporation's poverty guidelines. If a party, other than a party who initiated a judicial
proceeding under a pauper's oath, pays filing fees or costs at the time the services are
requested, such payment must be deemed to satisfy the requirement for security to be
given for filing fees or costs, pursuant to § 20-12-120. An attorney filing the judicial
SA0356
005430
- 1 -

proceeding must have the option to sign a cost bond in lieu of the party paying the
clerk's filing fees or costs at the time services are requested. The clerk shall not refuse
to file a judicial proceeding where the attorney has opted to sign a cost bond. In any
judicial proceeding where the clerk refuses to accept such cost bond in lieu of the party
paying the clerk's filing fees or costs, the clerk forfeits all filing fees or costs in that
judicial proceeding. These requirements for filing fees or costs to be paid or security
provided when services are requested from the clerk do not apply in criminal cases. The
filing fees and costs listed in this section do not include officer's fees as provided for in §
8-21-901 and elsewhere. These filing fees and costs also do not include state and local
litigation taxes.

institutions operating under the laws of the state or under the laws of the United

insurance corporation. Such investments shall not exceed the amounts that are
federally insured, unless otherwise fully collateralized under a written collateral
agreement, or unless the funds are deposited with an institution that is a member
of the state collateral pool. The clerk may invest funds in the local government
investment pool administered by the state treasurer. The earnings on such
investments must become part of the costs of the clerk and the clerk shall
account for earnings received the same as with other costs received. As used in
- 9 - 005430

this subdivision (i)(4), "idle funds" means those funds the clerk holds pursuant to
statute, local rules of court, or a court order that does not specifically direct the
clerk to invest the funds. This subdivision (i)(4) does not relieve the clerks from
the responsibility of investing funds held under their control pursuant to court
order or local rules of court directing the clerk to invest funds, and the earnings
on those investments must accrue to the benefit of those directed by the court or
by agreement of the parties to the judicial proceeding.
(5) Whenever the clerk is required by law or by a court to send
documents by certified or registered mail, the clerk is entitled to recover the
clerk's actual costs for mailing the documents.
(6) For the purposes of determining the filing fees of the clerk, when any
party files a third-party complaint, counter-complaint, or cross-complaint, the
party filing the third-party complaint, counter-complaint, or cross-complaint must
be charged the same filing fee as was charged at the initiation of the original
judicial proceeding.
(j) Earmarked Funds for Technology. Out of all the standard filing fees charged
by the clerks of the courts, seven dollars ($7.00) of each standard filing fee must be
earmarked for technology and for other usual and necessary technology-related
expenses at the discretion of the clerk. The clerk shall preserve these funds exclusively
for these purposes and these funds shall not revert to the general fund at the end of a
budget year, if unexpended.
(k) Costs in Extraordinary Cases. In any extraordinary cases, the clerk may
petition the court to award reasonable costs, in excess of the amounts provided in this

proceeding. In such judicial proceedings, the clerk may also petition the court to require
an appropriate cost bond. For the purposes of this subsection (k), an extraordinary case
means a case in which there are ten (10) or more parties.
- 10 - 005430

(l) Charges to the State Unchanged. Notwithstanding this section to the
contrary, any fees, costs, or commissions increased by this section that are assessed
against the state or that otherwise represent a charge to the state in criminal cases, child
support actions, mental health proceedings, judicial proceedings under the Tennessee
Adult Protection Act, compiled in title 71, chapter 6, part 1, judicial proceedings with
regard to child care licensing, and collection efforts brought by the department of human
services, are limited to the amounts chargeable prior to January 1, 2006.
(m) Indigent Parties. A clerk is not permitted to collect any filing fee or cost
authorized by this section without permitting any person the opportunity to institute a
judicial proceeding by means of a pauper's oath, in accordance with Rule 29 of the
Rules of the Supreme Court.
(n) Fees for Electronic Filing and Retrieval of Court Documents.
(1) In any court where electronic filing, signing, or verification of papers
has been authorized by local court rule and is in compliance with technological
standards established by the supreme court, clerks may assess a transaction fee
for each filing submitted by a party to the judicial proceeding. The transaction fee
is limited to a maximum of five dollars ($5.00) per filing up to a maximum of fifty
dollars ($50.00) per judicial proceeding. As an alternative to a transaction fee,
clerks may assess an annual subscription fee for each registered user of the
electronic filing system. The subscription fee permits the registered user
unlimited electronic filings for a one-year period. The one-year period must be
defined by the clerk and must be consistently maintained for all registered users
of the electronic filing system. The annual subscription fee shall not exceed
three hundred dollars ($300) for each annual period. Each of these fees must be
set in an amount necessary to defray the expenses associated with
implementation and maintenance of the electronic filing and document retrieval
- 11 - 005430

system and must be included in the local court rule authorizing it. Pursuant to
subsection (l), these fees shall not be assessed against the state.
(2) Pursuant to subsection (m), neither the transaction fee nor the
subscription fee must be assessed to a party declared indigent or to that indigent
party's legal representative.
(3) In any court where electronic filing, signing, or verification of papers
has been authorized by local court rule, the state and any department or
contractor of the state is not required to file documents electronically,
notwithstanding any local court rule.
(4) Neither the electronic filing transaction fee or subscription fee limit a
clerk's statutory authority to charge subscription fees or transaction fees for
obtaining copies of documents maintained by the clerk as part of an electronic
filing system of a separate document management system.
(o) Orders of Protection. Notwithstanding this section to the contrary, the clerks
of the courts shall collect filing fees, costs, litigation taxes, or any other costs associated
with the filing, issuance, registration, service, dismissal or nonsuit, appeal, or
enforcement of an ex parte order of protection, order of protection, or a petition for either
such order in the manner provided in § 36-3-617.
(p) Clerks' Report. The Tennessee state court clerks association must file a
report with the general assembly on or before December 31, 2028, proposing any
increases in the fees, costs, or commissions provided in this section; provided, however,
