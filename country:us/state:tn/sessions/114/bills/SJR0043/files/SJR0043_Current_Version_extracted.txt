SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 43
By Massey
A RESOLUTION to honor those individuals, organizations, and
agencies that came to the aid of their fellow
citizens during Hurricane Helene.
WHEREAS, on September 27, 2024, one of the most catastrophic floods ever to hit this
State devastated several areas across East Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, on that fateful day, the water rose rapidly across East Tennessee as
torrential rains fell, causing extensive damage in Carter, Cocke, Grainger, Greene, Hamblen,
Hawkins, Jefferson, Johnson, Sevier, Sullivan, Unicoi, and Washington counties; and
WHEREAS, these portions of East Tennessee suffered catastrophic flooding, with vast
swaths of communities washed away in the flood waters, and seventeen individuals were
confirmed to have lost their lives due to the rampaging water that reached an unprecedented
level; and
WHEREAS, without hesitation or concern for their own safety, citizens, community
organizations, and government agencies quickly stepped up and united with area first
responders and emergency personnel to help their fellow Tennesseans in distress, selflessly
making countless heroic efforts to rescue their neighbors from the flood waters; and
WHEREAS, as the good people of East Tennessee and the surrounding areas begin to
recover from this catastrophe, they are filled with gratitude for the many who risked their lives to
prevent further damage and to save those in danger; and
WHEREAS, they are grateful for and overwhelmed by the humanitarian efforts of the
many businesses, charitable and civic organizations, churches, government agencies, and
individuals who responded promptly and gave generously of their resources to help the people
of East Tennessee in their time of dire need; and

WHEREAS, local and State agencies involved in recovery efforts include the
Department of Commerce and Insurance, the Department of Environment and Conservation,
the Department of Health, the Department of Human Services, the Department of Labor and
Workforce Development, the Department of Military, the Department of Revenue, the
Department of Safety and Homeland Security, the Department of Transportation, Governor Bill
Lee and the Governor's offices, individual State employees, members of the General Assembly,
the Office of the First Lady, TennCare, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, the
Tennessee Highway Patrol, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, and countless other
individuals and volunteers; and
WHEREAS, it has been said that the human race is at its best when circumstances are
at their worst; this adage is proven by the generous and compassionate manner in which the
citizens of this great State and nation opened their hearts to the people of East Tennessee with
emergency and medical assistance, moral and financial support, and, most importantly, love
and understanding during the recent flooding disaster; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we commend and offer our appreciation and most
sincere thanks to all the first responders; firefighters; healthcare personnel; law enforcement
officers; missionary groups and churches; animal rescue groups; local, state, and federal
agencies; and corporations, individuals, businesses, organizations, and agencies that provided
professional assistance or humanitarian aid to the citizens of East Tennessee during the recent
flood that raged through the communities and surrounding areas. We extend our deepest
appreciation to those heroic, everyday Tennesseans, who, in a moment of great peril, came to
the aid and rescue of their neighbors and friends without hesitation; it is these unsung heroes
who comprise the very heart of the Volunteer State.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
