celebrating its fifth anniversary in 2025; and
WHEREAS, established by its CEO, Randy Dixon, and predicated on his metamorphic
journey through the art of boxing, the Elite Performance Foundation is a nonprofit organization

boxing, as well as fostering mental health awareness, self-discipline, and overall fitness; and
WHEREAS, growing up surrounded by the adverse effects of gun violence and gang
conflict in his community, Mr. Dixon gained a positive outlet for negativity by boxing with his
uncle; endowed with an entrepreneurial spirit and a drive for community improvement, Mr. Dixon
sought to replicate his own positive development through sport by creating a safe place for other
disadvantaged youth to find freedom in the ring; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Dixon has always emphasized the importance of mentorship and
personal development in his organization, seeking out coaches who have a knack for both
pugilism and empathy, and by partnering with local businesses, schools, and community
centers, the Elite Performance Foundation has quickly made in-roads of positive change in
Memphis through its positive, inspirational atmosphere and encouraging staff; and
