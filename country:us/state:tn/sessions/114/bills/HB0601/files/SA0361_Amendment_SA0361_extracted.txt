Section 2:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 40-26-105, is amended by deleting
subsections (a) and (b) and substituting the following:
(a) There is made available to convicted defendants in criminal cases a
proceeding in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis, to be governed by the same rules
and procedure applicable to the writ of error coram nobis in civil cases, except insofar as
inconsistent herewith. Notice of the suing out of the writ shall be served on the district
attorney general, by the convicted defendant, in cases in which the conviction occurred
following a trial, except in cases where a defendant has been sentenced to death, where
notice shall be served on the attorney general and reporter. In cases in which the
defendant entered a guilty, best interest, or no contest plea, the suing out of the writ
shall commence by order of the court for claims jointly presented for relief by the district
attorney general and the convicted defendant. A judge does not have authority to order
the writ to operate as a supersedeas. The court has authority to order the person having
custody of the petitioner to produce the petitioner in court for the hearing of the
proceeding.
(b) The relief obtainable by this proceeding shall be confined to errors dehors
the record and to matters that were not or could not have been litigated on the trial of the
case, on a motion for a new trial, on appeal in the nature of a writ of error, on writ of
error, or in a habeas corpus proceeding. Relief shall also apply to pleas of guilt, best
interest, or no contest. Upon a showing by the defendant that the defendant was without

will lie for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were
litigated at the trial, or unknown to the defendant at the time of plea, if the judge
determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment, had it been
presented at the trial, or known at the time of plea.

Section 3:
SECTION 2. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
