WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should specially recognize those outstanding
professionals who have devoted their careers to providing the highest quality education; and
WHEREAS, Hugh Harris is one such estimable educator, who has distinguished himself
as a professional of the greatest dedication, ability, and integrity, and is now retiring from his
role as headmaster and president of Franklin Christian Academy; and
WHEREAS, growing up in Waco, Texas, and Gainesville, Florida, Mr. Harris graduated
in 1978 from Baylor University with a degree in accounting, and he went on to work as an
accountant in the insurance industry, serving in such important roles as a treasurer and vice
president of finance; and
WHEREAS, in 1985, Mr. Harris began his own firm, which advised insurance companies
in the realms of accounting and computer systems, and Mr. Harris and his beloved wife, Lisa,
also moved their family, now with two adopted children, to work in an inner-city ministry that
started a school, church, and multiple youth ministries; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Harris moved to Nashville in 1991 to work with a friend's newly formed
venture, the Idea Agency, which produced life-affirming film, video, and music projects, and
after nine full years of innovation and creation, he decided to join his wife in education and
become the principal of a small Christian school in Franklin; and
WHEREAS, the Harrises, accompanied by twenty other families, began Franklin
Christian Academy in 2004, and Mr. Harris immediately deployed his vast wealth of talent and
knowledge accumulated over many years of multifarious work and interests to the benefit of the
new academic institution; and
