AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 55
and Title 65, Chapter 15, Part 3, relative to
transportation network companies.
WHEREAS, Tennessee is the only state in the southeast that allows out-of-state ride hail

our local economy, struggle to compete with an oversaturated market of out-of-state drivers;
