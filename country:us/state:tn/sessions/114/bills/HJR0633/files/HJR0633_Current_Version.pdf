HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 633
By Martin G
A RESOLUTION to recognize Buddy Templeton, owner of Creeks
Bend Golf Club.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should recognize
those Tennessee business owners who have a long-standing commitment to providing
exceptional service to their customers and members; and
WHEREAS, one such estimable businessman is Buddy Templeton, who has owned and
operated Creeks Bend Golf Club in Hixson for fifty years; and
WHEREAS, opened by the Templeton family along with other investors in 1968, Creeks
Bend Golf Club has had a long and successful history with its memberships and club events;
and
WHEREAS, over the years, Creeks Bend Golf Club has hosted a variety of tournaments,
including the first annual Coca-Cola Pro Am Tournament in the early 1970s; in 1978, golf
professional Mike Nelms came aboard as the Head Golf Professional; and
WHEREAS, each summer, the course hosts a Junior Golf Camp and Tournament for
children ages six to seventeen; this event treats junior golfers to a week of group and personal
instruction that culminates in a fun tournament, giving junior golfers an opportunity to show off
their newly honed golf skills; and
WHEREAS, Creeks Bend also hosts an annual Member-Member-Guest Tournament,
with participants competing for prizes and the coveted title of Club Champion; and
WHEREAS, for half a century, Buddy Templeton has ably stewarded one of this State's
finest golfing establishments, and it is most fitting that he and Creeks Bend Golf Club be
recognized at this time; now, therefore,
