SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-13-105(a), is amended by
deleting the first two sentences of the subsection and substituting:
There is established the Tennessee public charter school commission as an
independent state entity for the purpose of serving as a public charter school authorizer
- 6 - 007061

and the LEA for any public charter school it authorizes. The commission has the
authority to authorize public charter schools on appeal of a local board of education's
decision to deny a public charter school application and to directly authorize public
charter schools as provided in this chapter.
SECTION 3. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-13-106(i), is amended by adding
the following as a new subdivision:
(3) If a sponsor seeks to establish a new public charter school in an LEA
described in § 49-1-616(b), then the sponsor may apply to the local board of education
or directly to the commission for authorization pursuant to § 49-13-137, if applicable.
SECTION 4. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-13-106(j), is amended by deleting
subdivision (1) and substituting instead the following:
(1) If a sponsor seeks to convert an existing public school to a public charter
school, then the sponsor must apply to the local board of education. This subdivision
(j)(1) does not apply if the existing public school has entered the achievement school
district pursuant to § 49-1-614, or if the commissioner of education has recommended
that one (1) or more of the public schools managed and controlled by the local board of
education for an LEA described in § 49-1-616(b) be converted to a public charter school
pursuant to the process established in § 49-13-137.
SECTION 5. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 49, Chapter 13, is amended by adding
the following as a new section:
49-13-137.
(a) If a sponsor seeks to establish a new public charter school in an LEA
described in § 49-1-616(b), then the sponsor may apply directly to the commission for
authorization. If a sponsor applies directly to the commission, then the application
process must be conducted in accordance with § 49-13-107 and with the following:
(1) The commission shall rule by resolution, at a regularly or specially
called meeting, to approve or deny the public charter school application no later
- 7 - 007061

than ninety (90) days after the date on which the commission received the
completed application. If the commission fails to approve or deny a public
charter school application within ninety (90) days, then the public charter school
application is deemed approved;
(2) If the commission denies the application, then the grounds for denial
must be stated in writing and must specify objective reasons for the denial. Upon
receipt of the grounds for denial, the sponsor has thirty (30) days to submit an
amended application to correct any deficiencies. Upon receipt of the amended
application, the commission has sixty (60) days to deny or approve the amended
application. If the commission fails to approve or deny the amended application
within sixty (60) days, then the amended application is deemed approved;
(3) If the commission approves the application, then the commission is
the authorizer and LEA for that public charter school; and
(4) The commission's decision is final and not subject to appeal.
(b) If the commissioner of education recommends that one (1) or more of the
public schools in an LEA described in § 49-1-616(b) be converted to a public charter
school pursuant to § 49-1-616(c)(2), then a sponsor who seeks to convert an existing
public charter school for which the commissioner recommends conversion may apply
directly to the commission. If a sponsor applies directly to the commission for
conversion, then the application process must be conducted in accordance with § 49-13-
107 and with the process and timelines established in subdivisions (a)(1)-(4).
(c) If the commission approves a sponsor's application for conversion, then:
(1) The conversion must occur at the beginning of a school year and the
conversion public charter school must comply with this chapter;
(2) An enrollment preference must be given to students who reside in the
former school zone of the converted public school. The enrollment preference
- 8 - 007061

for students who reside in the former attendance area excludes the students from
entering into an enrollment lottery conducted pursuant to subdivision (c)(3);
(3) The conversion public charter school may enroll students who reside
in other school zones after students residing within the school zone of the
converted public school have had the opportunity to enroll, but only if there is
program, class, grade level, and building capacity to serve the out-of-zone
students. If applications by out-of-zone students exceed the conversion public
charter school's capacity, then enrollment of out-of-zone students must be
determined based on the results of an enrollment lottery. Out-of-zone students
who attended the school during the previous school year and the siblings of
students who attended the school may be given preference in enrollment; and
(4) The conversion public charter school shall occupy the converted
public school's existing facility.
(d) This section does not require the commission to approve an application to
establish a new public charter school in an LEA described in § 49-1-616(b) or to approve
an application for conversion of one (1) or more existing public schools in an LEA
described in § 49-1-616(b) for which the commissioner recommends conversion.
SECTION 6. If any provision of this act or the application of any provision of this act to
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or
applications of the act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
that end, the provisions of this act are severable.
SECTION 7. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
