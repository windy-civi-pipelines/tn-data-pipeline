(e)
- 9 - 007772

(1) If the state board concurs with a recommendation made by the
commissioner pursuant to subsection (c) to remove some or all of the local board
of education members or the director of schools, or both, for an LEA described in
subsection (a), then the commissioner shall order the removal of some or all of
the local board of education members or the director of schools, or both, and
shall declare a vacancy in the office.
(2) The local legislative body shall appoint the number of members
required to fill one (1) or more vacancies on the local board until the next general
election for which candidates may qualify and for which a candidate so elected
qualifies to hold the office, or for the remainder of the term if no general election
occurs during the remainder of the term. Each member appointed by the local
legislative body to fill a vacancy created pursuant to this section must be
confirmed by the state board of education before the member may begin serving
on the local board. If the state board rejects an appointment made by the local
legislative body, then the local legislative body shall appoint a new member to fill
the vacancy. If the state board similarly rejects the new appointment made by
the local legislative body, then the state board shall appoint a person who holds
the qualifications necessary to serve on the local board to fill the vacancy.
(3)
(A) The remaining members of the local board of education for a
special school district shall appoint the number of members required to fill
one (1) or more vacancies on the local board until the next general
election for which candidates may qualify and for which a candidate so
elected qualifies to hold the office, or for the remainder of the term if no
general election occurs during the remainder of the term.
(B) If all members of a local board of education for a special
school district are removed, then the commissioner shall appoint three (3)
- 10 - 007772

residents of the district to serve on the local board, and the three (3)
appointed members shall appoint residents of the district to fill any
remaining vacancies. The members appointed by the commissioner
pursuant to this subdivision (e)(3)(B) are not subject to confirmation and
may immediately begin serving on the local board.
(C) Each member appointed by the remaining or appointed
members of the local board of education for the special school district to
fill a vacancy created pursuant to this section must be confirmed by the
state board of education before the member may begin serving on the
local board. If the state board rejects an appointment made by the
remaining or appointed members of the local board, then the remaining or
appointed members of the local board shall appoint a new member to fill
the vacancy. If the state board similarly rejects the new appointment
made by the remaining or appointed members of the local board, then the
state board shall appoint a person who holds the qualifications necessary
to serve on the local board to fill the vacancy.
(4) A person appointed to fill a vacancy on a local board of education
serves the remainder of the vacated term upon their confirmation, if applicable.
(5)
(A) The local board of education shall appoint a person to fill a
vacancy in the office of the director of schools in accordance with § 49-2-
203. A person selected by the local board to fill a vacancy in the office of
the director of schools must be confirmed by the state board of education
before the person may assume the office. If the state board rejects an
appointment made by the local board, then the local board shall appoint a
new person to fill the vacancy in the office of the director of schools. If
the state board similarly rejects the new appointment made by the local
- 11 - 007772

board, then, notwithstanding another law to the contrary, the state board
shall provide the local board with a list of candidates who each hold the
qualifications necessary to serve as the director of schools, and the local
board shall select one (1) candidate from the list to fill the vacancy.
(B) If the commissioner has recommended that one (1) or more
members of the local board of education and the director of schools be
removed pursuant to subsection (c), and the state board has concurred
with both recommendations, then the local board shall not fill a vacancy in
the office of the director of schools until all vacancies on the local board
have been filled in accordance with this subsection (e).
(6) A member of a local board of education who is removed from office
pursuant to this section is ineligible for election to the office for the remainder of
their term and for one (1) full term thereafter. A director of schools who is
removed from office pursuant to this section is ineligible for appointment to the
office for the remainder of their contract term and for four (4) years thereafter.
(f) An appeal of the decision to remove a director of schools or local board of
education member pursuant to this section must be made to the three-judge panel
created in title 20, chapter 18. The three-judge panel's review is confined to whether or
not the decision was made in accordance with the procedures authorized in this section.
(g) To the extent any other provisions of this or any other title conflict with this
section, this section supersedes such provisions of law to the extent of the conflict for
the period of time for which an LEA described in subsection (a) is subject to one (1) or
more of the intervention actions and corresponding processes described in this section.
SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-2-203(a)(13), is amended by
adding the following as new subdivisions:
(D) If the mayor of a county or municipality for an LEA finds that the school
board for the LEA has employed three (3) or more directors of schools during the three
- 12 - 007772

(3) immediately preceding years and does not have a director of schools employed on a
basis other than interim, then the mayor may recommend that the local legislative body
employ a director of schools for the LEA under a written contract of up to four (4) years'
duration, which may be renewed by the school board in the same manner as if the
school board employed the director of schools. A director of schools employed for an
LEA by a local legislative body pursuant to this subdivision (a)(13)(D) has the same
powers and duties as a director of schools employed by a school board;
(E)
(i) If the LEA is subject to one (1) or more of the intervention actions
described in § 49-1-621(c), and the commissioner of education has
recommended to the state board of education that the director of schools be
replaced and the state board has concurred with the commissioner's
recommendation, then the director of schools shall be removed from office;
(ii) A removal from office pursuant to § 49-1-621 is a removal for cause,
immediately terminates the director of school's contract with the school board,
and does not require any prior written notice or any formal action or vote by the
school board in order to take effect;
(iii) A director of schools who is removed from office pursuant to § 49-1-
621 forfeits all compensation due under the director's contract of employment
with the school board beginning on the date of the director's removal. The
director may be compensated for actual services performed by the director in the
director's official capacity before the date of the director's removal. A director of
schools who is removed from office pursuant to § 49-1-621 must not receive any
compensation that is payable only on the director's separation from employment;
SECTION 3. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-6-2602(3), is amended by
deleting subdivision (D) and substituting instead the following:
- 13 - 007772

(D) Except for a student who is zoned to attend a school in an LEA described in
§ 49-1-621(a), is a member of a household with an annual income for the previous year
that does not exceed twice the federal income eligibility guidelines for free lunch;

attend a school in an LEA described in § 49-1-621(a). Notwithstanding this part to the
contrary, if the LEA in which the eligible student is zoned to attend a school met the
description in § 49-1-621(a) at the time the parent of the eligible student or the eligible
student, as applicable, submitted an application to participate in the program, then the
student is not required to verify the student's household income for any year for which
the student participates in the program, even if the LEA in which the student is zoned to
attend a school no longer meets the description in § 49-1-621(a).
SECTION 5. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-6-2603, is amended by deleting
the language "as applicable" in subdivision (d)(2) and substituting instead "as applicable, who is
required to verify that the participating student's household income meets the requirements of §
49-6-2602(3)(D)" and by deleting the language "as applicable," wherever it appears in
subdivision (f)(2) and substituting instead "as applicable, who is required to verify that the
participating student's household income meets the requirements of § 49-6-2602(3)(D)".
SECTION 6. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-6-2604(a), is amended by
deleting subdivision (6) and substituting instead the following:
(6) An income verification process for a parent of a participating student who is
seventeen (17) years of age or younger, or a participating student who has reached
eighteen (18) years of age, as applicable, who is required to verify that the participating
student's household income meets the requirements of § 49-6-2602(3)(D) to verify the
participating student's household income.

SECTION 7. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-13-105(a), is amended by
deleting the first two sentences of the subsection and substituting:
There is established the Tennessee public charter school commission as an
independent state entity for the purpose of serving as a public charter school
authorizer and the LEA for any public charter school it authorizes. The
commission has the authority to authorize public charter schools on appeal of a
local board of education's decision to deny a public charter school application
and to directly authorize public charter schools as provided in this chapter.
SECTION 8. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-13-106(i), is amended by adding
the following as a new subdivision:
(3) If a sponsor seeks to establish a new public charter school in an LEA
described in § 49-1-621(a), then the sponsor may apply to the local board of education
or directly to the commission for authorization pursuant to § 49-13-146, if applicable.
SECTION 9. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 49-13-106(j)(1), is amended by
adding the following at the end of the subdivision:
This subdivision (j)(1) does not apply if the commissioner of education has
recommended that one (1) or more of the public schools managed and controlled
by the local board of education for an LEA described in § 49-1-621(a) be
converted to a public charter school pursuant to the process in § 49-13-146.
SECTION 10. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 49, Chapter 13, is amended by adding
the following as a new section:
49-13-146. Direct authorization by the Tennessee public charter school
commission for charter schools applying in certain underperforming school districts.
(a) If a sponsor seeks to establish a new public charter school in an LEA
described in § 49-1-621(a), then the sponsor may apply directly to the commission for
authorization. If a sponsor applies directly to the commission, then the application
process must be conducted in accordance with § 49-13-107 and with the following:
- 15 - 007772

(1) The commission shall rule by resolution, at a regularly or specially
called meeting, to approve or deny the public charter school application no later
than ninety (90) days after the date on which the commission received the
completed application. If the commission fails to approve or deny a public
charter school application within ninety (90) days, then the public charter school
application is deemed approved;
(2) If the commission denies the application, then the grounds for denial
must be stated in writing and must specify objective reasons for the denial. Upon
receipt of the grounds for denial, the sponsor has thirty (30) days to submit an
amended application to correct any deficiencies. Upon receipt of the amended
application, the commission has sixty (60) days to deny or approve the amended
application. If the commission fails to approve or deny the amended application
within sixty (60) days, then the amended application is deemed approved;
(3) If the commission approves the application, then the commission is
the authorizer and LEA for that public charter school; and
(4) The commission's decision is final and not subject to appeal.
(b) If the commissioner of education recommends that one (1) or more of the
public schools in an LEA described in § 49-1-621(a) be converted to a public charter
school pursuant to § 49-1-621(c), then a sponsor who seeks to convert a public school
for which the commissioner recommends conversion to a public charter school may
apply directly to the commission. If a sponsor applies directly to the commission for
conversion, then the application process must be conducted in accordance with § 49-13-
107 and with the process and timelines established in subdivisions (a)(1)-(4).
(c) If the commission approves a sponsor's application for conversion, then:
(1) The conversion must occur at the beginning of a school year and the
conversion public charter school must comply with this chapter;
- 16 - 007772

(2) A teacher or administrator of the conversion public charter school
must be allowed to transfer into vacant positions in other schools in the LEA for
which they are certified before the LEA hires new personnel to fill the vacant
positions. Personnel who transfer into vacant positions in other schools in the
LEA must not suffer any impairment, interruption, or diminution of the rights and
privileges of a then-existing teacher or administrator, and the rights and
privileges must continue without impairment, interruption, or diminution with the
local board of education. For purposes of this subdivision (c)(2), "rights and
privileges" include, but are not limited to, salary, pension, retirement benefits,
sick leave accumulation, tenure, seniority, and contract rights with the local board
of education. The director of schools may assign teachers or administrators in a
conversion public charter school to vacant positions in other schools in the LEA;
(3) An enrollment preference must be given to students who reside in the
former school zone of the converted public school. The enrollment preference
for students who reside in the former attendance area excludes the students from
entering into an enrollment lottery conducted pursuant to subdivision (c)(4);
(4) The conversion public charter school may enroll students who reside
in other school zones after students residing within the school zone of the
converted public school have had the opportunity to enroll, but only if there is
program, class, grade level, and building capacity to serve the out-of-zone
students. If applications by out-of-zone students exceed the conversion public
charter school's capacity, then enrollment of out-of-zone students must be
determined based on the results of an enrollment lottery. Out-of-zone students
who attended the school during the previous school year and the siblings of
students who attended the school may be given preference in enrollment;
(5) A parent of a child who is enrolled at the conversion public school
may enroll the parent's child in another public school without penalty; and
- 17 - 007772

(6) The conversion public charter school shall occupy the converted
public school's existing facility.
(d) This section does not require the commission to approve an application to
establish a new public charter school in an LEA described in § 49-1-621(a) or to approve
an application for conversion of one (1) or more existing public schools in an LEA
described in § 49-1-621(a) for which the commissioner recommends conversion.
SECTION 11. The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not
constitute a part of the law enacted by this act. However, the Tennessee Code Commission is
requested to include the headings in any compilation or publication containing this act.
SECTION 12. Sections 3-6 of this act take effect July 1, 2025, the public welfare
requiring it, and apply to the 2025-2026 school year and each school year thereafter. All other
sections of this act take effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
