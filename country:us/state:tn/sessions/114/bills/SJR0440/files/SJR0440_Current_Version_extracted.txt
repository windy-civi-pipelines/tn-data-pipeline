Division I, Class 3A state championship.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Lady Mountaineers girls'
basketball team of Heritage High School in Blount County, whose members have proven
themselves to be the fiercest of competitors and truly worthy of admiration by winning the 2025
TSSAA Division I, Class 3A state championship, marking the first team state championship in
school history and the first girls' basketball state championship won by an area team since
Porter (one of Heritage's predecessor schools) claimed the title in 1969; and
WHEREAS, entering regional competition as District 5 champions, the Lady
Mountaineers trounced Red Bank 79-27 in the quarterfinals and rolled over South-Doyle 70-55
in the semifinal round; and
WHEREAS, Heritage vanquished Lenoir City 57-51 in the regional final to advance to
the sectional round, where the Lady Mountaineers overpowered Livingston Academy 71-56 to
punch their ticket to the Big Dance; and
WHEREAS, at the Class 3A state tournament at MTSU's Murphy Center, Heritage
crushed Portland 60-36 in the quarterfinals and then bested South Gibson 36-29 in their
semifinal match-up to advance to the final; and
WHEREAS, Heritage's Carsyn Swaney, a Tennessee Miss Basketball finalist, suffered
an injury in the semifinals and was unable to play in the championship game; switching tactics,

Coach Rick Howard emphasized the importance of the team's underclassmen in the face of
adversity; and
WHEREAS, Isabella "Izzy" Hutsell set the tone for the championship game by singing in
the opening of the National Anthem; her teammates responded, and the Lady Mountaineers
creamed Northview Academy 63-43 to win the Gold Ball trophy that signifies a state champion
and finish the campaign with a remarkable 35-2 record; and
WHEREAS, led by senior Chloe Heath, sophomores Kenley Coker, Faith Morris, and
Katie Graves stepped up to the challenge and contributed offensively in their star's absence;
and
WHEREAS, Aleyah Smyth put on a defensive clinic, and Emma Carswell and Olivia
Boyce came off the bench to contribute both offensively and defensively; and
WHEREAS, in addition to the aforementioned hoopsters, the other team members
expended significant energy and excitement in cheering their team on to a historic victory; these
hardy Lady Mountaineers included Cheyann Morris, Allison Perry, Natalie Byrd, Isabella Hutsell,
Makenna Miller, Gracelyn Livingston, and Micah Parker; and
WHEREAS, Coach Howard and his assistant coaches, Jordan Ballard, Jay Coker, and
Kirsten Roberts, displayed strategic leadership, and their ability to adapt to every challenge was
crucial in ultimately leading Heritage to a state championship; and
WHEREAS, the Lady Mountaineers were fortunate to enjoy the unfailing support of their
families, fans, fellow students, and the entire Blount County community; and

in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in competition
while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and

and the team chemistry among the players was evident in every game, as they treated the Lady
Mountaineer program as a sisterhood; and
WHEREAS, we find it appropriate to acknowledge and applaud the Heritage Lady
Mountaineers for their outstanding season on the hardwood; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH

REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor and congratulate the Heritage Lady
Mountaineers girls' basketball team upon winning the 2025 TSSAA Division I, Class 3A state
