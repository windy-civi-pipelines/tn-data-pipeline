perseverance in her fight with polio, even after her doctors told her that she would be unable to

earning her doctorate in communicative disorders, and went on to teach for over thirty years
combined at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the University of Arkansas for Medical

linguistic difficulties, Dr. Davis was a member of the American Speech-Language-Hearing
Association for forty-five years; and

decade, enlightened her students in such subjects as speech development, articulation

WHEREAS, Dr. Davis exhibited her aptitude for effective leadership at the University of
Alabama as a member of the Faculty Senate, the chairman of the Promotion and Tenure
Committee, and the president of the Black Faculty and Staff Association; and
WHEREAS, committed to racial equality on campus and beyond, she served as the
faculty advisor to the NAACP; and
WHEREAS, as she enters her eightieth year, Dr. Davis, admired for her wisdom, spirit of
generosity, integrity, and enthusiasm for life, still exudes the goodness that is so
characteristically hers; and
WHEREAS, we wish to grasp this golden opportunity to specially recognize one of
Tennessee's most outstanding citizens on this very special occasion; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
