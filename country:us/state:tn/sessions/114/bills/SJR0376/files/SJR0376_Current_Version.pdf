SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 376
By Crowe
A RESOLUTION to honor the Tennessee Federation of
Republican Women on the occasion of the
organization's seventieth anniversary.
WHEREAS, Republican Women's clubs were formed many years before women
received the right to vote; and
WHEREAS, the Republican Platform of 1872 stated that The Republican Party is mindful
of its obligation to the loyal women of America for their noble devotion to the cause of freedom;
and
WHEREAS, in 1938, Marion Martin, assistant chairman to the Republican National
Committee, called a meeting at the Palmer House in Chicago, Illinois, to organize Republican
Women's clubs into a National Organization; and
WHEREAS, the National Federation of Republican Women's Clubs adopted rules, one
of which was "to foster and encourage loyalty to the Republican Party and the ideals for which it
stands"; and
WHEREAS, at the time of the organization's founding, there were only six Republican
governors, eighty-nine Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, and sixteen
Republicans in the U.S. Senate; and
WHEREAS, in its early days, the organization was a lobbying group that continued to
grow, eventually changing its name to the National Federation of Republican Women (NFRW) in
1953; and
WHEREAS, the NFRW, once an auxiliary of the Republican National Committee,
became financially and organizationally independent in 1952; and

WHEREAS, in 1955, the Tennessee Federation of Republican Women was chartered,
with Alice Elder of Chattanooga serving as its first president; and
WHEREAS, Sharon Boreing is serving as president on this seventieth anniversary; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee Federation of Republican Women has clubs across the
State that, in the seventy years since the state organization's founding, have taken part in
programs to help in their communities, including those focused on caring for America, literacy,
Americanism, armed services, and scholarship programs for women; most importantly, the
organization has earned hundreds of thousands of campaign volunteer hours and received
dozens of NFRW Achievement Awards in these areas; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee Federation of Republican Women is celebrating its
seventieth year while still supporting candidates through the Iris Fund PAC, still campaigning for
and electing Republicans in Tennessee, and still contributing to the success of growing a super
majority; now, therefore,
