(A) Establish an internet-based, consumer-friendly platform that
educates and informs enrollees about the price and quality of healthcare
services and providers, including the average amount paid in each county
for healthcare services and providers. The average amounts paid for
such services and providers must, where appropriate, be expressed for
service bundles, which include all products and services associated with

products and services;

(D) Identify the cost savings realized to the enrollee and this state

providers, and facilitate a shared cost savings payment to the enrollee.
The amount of shared cost savings must be determined by a
methodology established by the third-party vendor and the department of
finance and administration, in collaboration with the committees, that
must maximize value-based purchasing by enrollees based on historical
claims data. At the discretion of the enrollee, the amount payable to the
enrollee may be:
(i) Credited to a qualified flexible or health benefits or
savings account offered to an enrollee under a healthcare plan; or
