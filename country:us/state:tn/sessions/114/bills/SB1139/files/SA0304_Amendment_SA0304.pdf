In the event that an act of God, fire, flood, storm, accident, or similar event
constituting force majeure causes a utility to require more time to meet the review
requirements of this part, then the timelines set forth in this part must be suspended for
so long as the utility's operations are impacted by one (1) or more such events.
SECTION 2. The headings in this act are for reference purposes only and do not
constitute a part of the law enacted by this act. However, the Tennessee Code Commission is
