SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 141
By Reeves
A RESOLUTION commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the
end of the Vietnam War.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should commemorate those solemn
events in our nation's history that recognize the sacrifices made by our veterans on behalf of
their fellow Americans; and
WHEREAS, May 7, 2025, marks the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War;
and
WHEREAS, Tennessee has always treasured her veterans and their many contributions
to our continued liberty, safety, and welfare, and thus it comes as no surprise that in 2008, the
Volunteer State became the first state in the nation to pass legislation observing Vietnam
Veterans Day; and
WHEREAS, the United States first became involved in Vietnam on November 1, 1955,
when President Dwight D. Eisenhower committed military advisors to educate and train the
Army of the Republic of Vietnam, actions that marked the official beginning of American
involvement in the Vietnam War; and
WHEREAS, on January 12, 1962, United States Army pilots lifted more than 1,000
South Vietnamese service members over jungle and underbrush to capture a National
Liberation Front stronghold near Saigon. Operation Chopper marked America's first combat
mission against the Viet Cong and the beginning of one of our longest and most challenging
wars; and
WHEREAS, through more than a decade of conflict that tested the fabric of our nation,
the service of our men and women in uniform stood true. More than sixty years after that fateful
mission, we honor the Americans who served, pay tribute to those we have laid to rest, and

reaffirm our dedication to showing a generation of veterans the respect and support of a grateful
nation; and
WHEREAS, the Vietnam War is a story of service members of different backgrounds,
colors, and creeds who came together to complete a daunting mission; it is a story of patriots
who braved the line of fire, who cast themselves into harm's way to save a friend, and who
fought hour after hour, day after day, to preserve the liberties we hold dear while upholding the
highest traditions of our Armed Forces; and
WHEREAS, 9,087,000 personnel served from August 5, 1964, to May 7, 1975, and
2,709,918 served on the ground in Vietnam; two-thirds of those who served were volunteers
and not drafted, and 11,000 women served in Vietnam in various roles, including nursing, the
Red Cross, and other military roles; and
WHEREAS, more than 2.5 million personnel served in the Republic of South Vietnam,
including 1,736,000 in the Army, 391,000 in the Marines, 174,000 in the Navy and Coast Guard,
and 293,000 in the Air Force; and
WHEREAS, there are 6.6 million Vietnam War veterans still living, and one in every
three males over the age of sixty-five is a Vietnam War veteran; the second-largest Vietnam
Veterans of America Chapter in the nation is in Chattanooga, which has more than 1,000
members; and
WHEREAS, half a century after the official end of the Vietnam War on May 7, 1975, we
pay tribute to the fallen, the missing, the wounded, the millions who served, and the millions
more who awaited their return. Our nation stands stronger for their service, and we honor their
proud legacy with our deepest gratitude; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that as we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the

them for their service to this great nation, and extend to them our best wishes for every
continued success and happiness.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
