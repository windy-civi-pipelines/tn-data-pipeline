qualified appraisers, one (1) selected by the LEA and one (1) selected by the
owner of the child care agency; and

the authorizer or the Tennessee public charter school commission on appeal
issues the ultimate, unappealable decision to approve or deny the public charter
school application after the sponsor, as defined in § 49-13-104, has exhausted all
available options to amend the application or appeal a denial of the application.
