HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 327
By Barrett
A RESOLUTION to commemorate Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes and
Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders Awareness
Month.
WHEREAS, Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of thirteen heritable
connective tissue disorders that together affect one in 5,000 people. Each type of EDS has its
own set of symptoms, but some features are seen across all types of EDS, including joint
hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility; and
WHEREAS, hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) are connective tissue disorders
that cause joint hypermobility, instability, injury, and pain. Other symptoms, such as fatigue,
headaches, GI problems, and autonomic dysfunction are also often seen as part of HSD; and
WHEREAS, there is no cure for any type of EDS or HSD; the conditions are managed by
addressing a person's symptoms. EDS and HSD can cause a variety of symptoms in many
different areas of the body, so people with these conditions often require multiple providers in
different specialties to manage their care; and
WHEREAS, access to professionals who are knowledgeable about EDS and HSD is
limited in Tennessee; lack of awareness about EDS and HSD in Tennessee and across the
world stands in the way of the diagnosis, management, and research of these conditions; and
WHEREAS, awareness about EDS and HSD by both medical professionals and the
general public can help improve the lives of people living with EDS and HSD in Tennessee;
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we join with the citizens of Tennessee as they commemorate the month of
HJR0327

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
