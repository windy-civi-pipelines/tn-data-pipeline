a broad range of programs aimed at helping Chamber members navigate the hardships of the
recession; and

Junior Achievement, in which position he operated from the organization's headquarters in
Colorado Springs, Colorado; he returned to Nashville in 1996 and accepted a similar national
role with the National Federation of Independent Business; and
WHEREAS, Ralph Schulz went on to serve the Adventure Science Center as CEO for
six years, during which time he helped the team focus on turning an aging, science-based

the Science Center was duly recognized by the Center for Nonprofit Management with the

Committee for Bus Rapid Transit; he currently serves as a member of the MTA Strategic Plan
Advisory Committee; and
