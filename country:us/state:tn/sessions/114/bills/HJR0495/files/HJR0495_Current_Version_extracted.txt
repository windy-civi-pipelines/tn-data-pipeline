Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 495
By Howell
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Bradley Central
Bearettes girls' basketball team upon winning its
third consecutive TSSAA Division I, Class 4A
state championship.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lasses is the Bearettes girls' basketball team
of Bradley Central High School, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of
competitors and truly worthy of admiration by winning their third consecutive TSSAA Division I,
Class 4A state championship, thus completing a three-peat, the seedlings of which were planted
in 2023, budded in 2024, and blossomed in 2025; and
WHEREAS, the Bearettes' third consecutive Gold Ball state championship trophy and
their fourth in the last seven seasons increases the storied program's total to nine TSSAA state
titles since 1960, the second-highest total in Tennessee history; and
WHEREAS, five of these nine championships were won under legendary coach Jim
Smiddy, but the final four are directly attributable to the tactical genius and inspiring leadership
of Head Coach Jason Reuter, whose overall record is now 456-45 in fifteen seasons at the
helm, with a program-best 91 percent winning percentage; and
WHEREAS, entering the Class 4A state tournament at MTSU's Murphy Center with a
near perfect 32-1 mark, Bradley Central defeated Coffee County 53-44 in the quarterfinals and
then walloped Bearden 66-39 in their semifinal match-up to advance to the final; and
WHEREAS, facing Bartlett in the championship game for the third consecutive year, the
Bearettes completed the three-peat by demolishing their rivals 70-28; and

- 1 -
WHEREAS, Bradley Central's dominant victory marked only the fifth time a state
championship game has been decided by more than 30 points, and the team's 42-point margin
of victory over Bartlett ranks as the highest point difference in a title game since 1926; and
WHEREAS, in addition to winning their third consecutive state title, the Bearettes
finished the season ranked second in one national high school poll and fourth in another; and
WHEREAS, the Bradley Central Bearettes' 35-1 record for the 2024-2025 season
improves their mark to an incredible 104-3 for the three seasons of their consecutive state titles;
senior three-year starters Harmonie Ware and Avary Brewer, who were key reserves on the
varsity as freshmen, posted a career 133-7 record to finish their exemplary high school careers;
and
WHEREAS, the Bearettes relied heavily upon the athleticism, leadership, and
determination of their five starters, Kimora Fields, Harmonie Ware, Avary Brewer, TaTianna
Stovall, and Malia Wilcox, all of whom were named to the All-State Tournament team; and
WHEREAS, eight seniors from this championship team will graduate in 2025, a half
dozen of whom have already accepted collegiate scholarship offers, including Harmonie Ware
(Arkansas), TaTianna Stovall (Kennesaw State), Avary Brewer (Samford), Malia Wilcox
(Walters State), Alliyah Osborn (Cleveland State), and Love Howard (Chattanooga State); and
WHEREAS, the remaining members of the 2024-2025 Bearettes are Libby Stewart,
Hallie Rymer, Abby White, Addie Geren, Jada Francis, Makayla Broome, and Madeline Shultz;
and
WHEREAS, Bradley Central's superb performance would not have been possible
without the expert guidance of Coach Reuter and his assistant coaches, Adam Belford, Keith
Freeman, and Amy Tinsley, and the unfailing support of the players' families, their fans, and
their community; and
- 2 - 005849
WHEREAS, the members of the Bradley Central girls' basketball team epitomize all that
is good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in
competition while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, the perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent of this group of
young women not only made possible a three-peat but also surely bode well for their future
success; and
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly find it appropriate to acknowledge
and applaud the Bradley Central Bearettes for their outstanding season on the hardwood; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend the members of the Bradley Central Bearettes
girls' basketball team upon winning their third consecutive TSSAA Division I, Class 4A state
tournament, applaud their three-peat as state champions, and extend to them our best wishes
for every continued success in all their future endeavors.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
