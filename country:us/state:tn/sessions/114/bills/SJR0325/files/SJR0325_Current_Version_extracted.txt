Section 1:
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 325
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory Ava May Christopher.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should honor the lives of those citizens who, although
their time on earth may have been brief, made a profound impact on those who were fortunate
to know them; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy individual was Ava May Christopher of Memphis, who
was born on May 8, 2003, to Chris and Angela Christopher; and
WHEREAS, as a child, she was an epic dichotomy of shyness and a girl who knew what
she wanted; she was emotionally attuned and empathetic, and she deeply loved her friends,
family, horse Ozzi, calico Jazzy, and other family pets; and
WHEREAS, Ava was clever and fun, and it was always her goal to make others laugh
and smile; she loved music and theater and excelled at performance, always working diligently
to improve her vocal and acting skills; and
WHEREAS, she performed in a number of local shows at the Historic Ruffin, New Day
Children's Theatre, The University of Memphis, and Theatre Memphis, preparing for hours and
days for each and every audition; and
WHEREAS, Ava Christopher also enjoyed working behind the scenes as an assistant
director, stage manager, dresser—anything to be involved in a show; her dedication was no
different as a barrel racer and a member of the drill team. She knew what she wanted and
would work tirelessly to achieve it, while at the same time happily cheering on her friends and
their horses; and

WHEREAS, at the time of her passing, she was preparing to enter her junior year at the
University of Memphis, where she was a biology major with minors in vocal music and theater;
she had hoped to go to veterinary school after graduation; and
WHEREAS, Ava loved everyone from all walks of life and believed in acceptance,
tolerance, and love; she packed more love, humor, knowledge, moxie, and experiences into her
short twenty years than many do in much longer lifetimes; and
WHEREAS, she was also deeply devoted to her family, and she always endeavored to
remain true to family values of the highest order; and
WHEREAS, in addition to her beloved parents, Ava Christopher left to cherish her
memory her sister, Kat; grandparents, Jim and Barbara Christopher, and Debbie and Bob
Mosely; great-grandmother, Dorthy Sturm; and a host of extended family and friends; and
WHEREAS, Ava leaves behind an indelible legacy of joy, determination, and kindness
that will continue to resonate through those she loved; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should remember the bountiful life of this exceptional
young lady; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of Ava May Christopher,
reflecting fondly upon her brief life well lived, extending our condolences to her many loved
ones.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
