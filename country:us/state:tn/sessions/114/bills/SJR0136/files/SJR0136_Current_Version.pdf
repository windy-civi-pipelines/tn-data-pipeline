SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 136
By Seal
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Reverend William L.
Swafford.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of Reverend William L.
Swafford of Talbott, a veteran, religious leader, inspiring pastor, humble servant of God, and
faithful friend; and
WHEREAS, after serving in the U.S. Navy during the Cold War era, Reverend Swafford
studied at Belmont College and then at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville,
Kentucky; and
WHEREAS, serving as a pastor for seventy years, Reverend Swafford led the people of
Talbott Baptist Church to cherish the things of heaven and not cling to the things of earth, and
through his long service on several committees of the Tennessee Baptist Convention, the
effects of his shepherding surpassed the local confines of his congregation; and
WHEREAS, he was known as a man of God and led his people to discover the graces in
this pilgrimage, and he confirmed and comforted his people in faith, whether marking the new
beginnings of marriages or commemorating at funerals those who have fallen asleep; and
WHEREAS, Reverend Swafford actively cultivated his God-given talents, and his artistry
in woodworking is a testament to his multifarious skillset; and
WHEREAS, a true servant-leader, Reverend Swafford generously gave much of his time
volunteering in local senior centers, and he always manifested a loving care that revealed the
effect of grace within him; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his good work from the pulpit and beyond, Reverend Swafford
was wholly devoted to his family and friends, and he is still cherished and remembered by his
son, Jeff (Michelle) Swafford; his daughter, Patrice Swafford Welch; his grandchildren, Ashley

seven decades, and he should be remembered for his many contributions and the example he
set for others; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
