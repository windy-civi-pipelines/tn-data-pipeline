HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 182
By Hulsey
A RESOLUTION to designate June 2025 as "Nuclear Family
Month" in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, the nuclear family, consisting of one husband, one wife, and any biological,
adopted, or fostered children, is God's design for familial structure and has been the bedrock of
society since the creation of the world; and
WHEREAS, the nuclear family was the basic building block of Tennessee's society
throughout her formative years; and
WHEREAS, the nuclear family built the United States of America and created prosperity
within our nation; and
WHEREAS, fatherless families are four times more likely to live in poverty than married-
couple families; children without fathers are ten times more likely to abuse chemical substances;
children from fatherless homes are more likely to have mental health and behavioral issues;
sixty percent of youth suicides are from fatherless homes; seventy-one percent of high school
dropouts are from fatherless homes; fatherless youths are twenty times more likely to be
incarcerated; eighty-five percent of youths in prison come from fatherless homes; and in a 2016
study by Peter Langman on the psychology behind fifty-six school shooters, eighty-two percent
of the shooters were raised in an unstable family environment or without both biological parents
together; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee's values do not align with the humanistic, globalist ideologies of
the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and like-minded organizations that fight for
population control through the means of promoting sterilization and abortion practices; and
WHEREAS, the nuclear family is God's perfect design for humanity and is aligned with
the long-held traditional values of Tennessee; and
