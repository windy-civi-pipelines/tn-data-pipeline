Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 131
By Sparks
A RESOLUTION to raise awareness of the importance of positive
male role models and mentorship opportunities
in schools, nonprofit organizations, and faith-
based organizations.
WHEREAS, many children in our country do not have positive father figures or male role
models involved in their education, as, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, 17.25 million
children are being raised in a single-mother family; and
WHEREAS, children who have fathers or positive male role models involved in their lives
are more likely to get better grades, have better verbal and problem-solving skills, and do better
on achievement tests; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of Education reported in 2012 that such children also
demonstrate a higher tolerance for stress and frustration and are more likely to have positive
peer relationships, to participate in extracurricular activities, and to have fewer discipline
problems; and
WHEREAS, studies have also shown that the involvement of a father or positive male
role model in the lives of children promotes a child's physical well-being, greater ability to take
initiative, and evidence of self-control; and
WHEREAS, mentoring programs in schools have proven to be a cost-efficient way of
increasing the positive relationships students have in their lives, while also having the potential
to boost factors that can lead to educational success; and
WHEREAS, community-based mentoring programs operated by nonprofit organizations
or faith-based organizations can help ensure that today's students have positive male role
models in their lives, helping to give them the tools and support they need to succeed by

improving social skills, bolstering self-esteem, and providing career exploration while also
supporting academic activities; and
WHEREAS, by working together, local organizations can establish mentorship
opportunities that specifically meet the needs of those children who do not have positive male
role models in their lives; and
WHEREAS, the expansion of such mentorship programs in the State of Tennessee by
schools, nonprofit organizations, and faith-based organizations would be a benefit to countless
students in the areas of educational attainment, future employment potential, and social well-
being; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we hereby acknowledge the importance of positive male role models in the
lives of Tennessee's children and urge schools, nonprofit organizations, and faith-based
organizations to place more positive male role models in our schools and classrooms through
mentorship opportunities.
