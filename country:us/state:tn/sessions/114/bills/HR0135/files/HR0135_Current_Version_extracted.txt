Section 1:
HOUSE RESOLUTION 135
By Vital
A RESOLUTION to honor the Tennessee Valley Authority for its
legacy of service to the people of Tennessee
and the broader region.
WHEREAS, we find it appropriate to recognize and commend institutions whose lasting
mission and service have contributed significantly to the prosperity, progress, and well-being of
this State and its citizens; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), established more than ninety years
ago, delivers energy to more than ten million people across seven states through a partnership
with 153 local power companies, including electric cooperatives and municipal electric
providers, serving rural, suburban, and urban communities across Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee and the broader TVA service area are experiencing historic
levels of population and industrial growth, placing new demands on power generation,
transmission, and infrastructure; and
WHEREAS, TVA has met these demands with a legacy of reliability, strategic foresight,
and a deep commitment to keeping electricity affordable for homes, farms, and businesses
throughout the Valley; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee's electric cooperatives and municipal electric utilities play a
critical role in this effort, working in close partnership with TVA to provide dependable, around-
the-clock service and to invest in the local communities they serve; and
WHEREAS, the board of directors of TVA plays a vital role in setting the direction of the
Authority, including decisions on power supply, long-term planning, rates, and capital
investment; and

WHEREAS, several current vacancies on the TVA board present a timely and important
opportunity for the President of the United States to appoint individuals who reflect TVA's
customer-first mission and possess the experience necessary to lead the Authority into its next
chapter; and
WHEREAS, individuals with experience at TVA's 153 local power company partners—
including leaders from electric cooperatives and municipally owned utilities—bring real-world
insight to energy delivery, ratepayer accountability, and the daily responsibility of providing
uninterrupted electric service; and
WHEREAS, the governance structure of cooperatively owned generation and
transmission utilities, in which all board members are also customers and owners, offers a
valuable model of customer-driven oversight that prioritizes affordability, transparency, and
community investment—values central to TVA's mission; and
WHEREAS, continued strong leadership at TVA will ensure that the needs of rural,
suburban, and urban communities are reflected, that reliability remains paramount, and that
TVA is positioned to support economic growth throughout the Valley region for years to come;
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor and
commend the Tennessee Valley Authority for its exceptional service, enduring mission, and
lasting impact on the people of Tennessee.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that certified copies of this resolution be prepared for
presentation to the Tennessee Valley Authority, the President of the United States, and each
member of Tennessee's Congressional delegation.
