HOUSE BILL 399
By Bricken
SENATE BILL 470
By Harshbarger
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 12
and Title 49, relative to school safety.
WHEREAS, the alarming rise in school violence incidents, including those at after-school
events, and recent threats have underscored the urgent need for proactive steps to bolster
school safety for Tennessee students and communities, and to ensure secure learning
environments; and
WHEREAS, disparities in resources among districts can lead to an inequitable
distribution of security measures, notably in the availability of walk-through metal detectors,
resulting in some local education agencies (LEAs) having access to these essential tools, while
others lack the necessary funding mechanisms to safeguard their communities effectively; and
WHEREAS, it is imperative that each LEA in the State has equitable access to essential
safety equipment. To address this need, this act introduces a pilot program focused on at-risk
and distressed LEAs by providing grants for the acquisition of portable metal detectors, ensuring
schools can deter potential threats and promote a secure atmosphere for students and staff,
both during school hours and at after-school events; and
WHEREAS, it is the intent of this General Assembly to ensure that no school is left
unprotected due to financial constraints, beginning with the State's most vulnerable
communities, and to evaluate the effectiveness of providing targeted security resources; and
WHEREAS, by instituting a grant program to cover the full cost of obtaining, installing,
and training personnel on the use of walk-through metal detectors, the State of Tennessee
declares its unwavering commitment to fostering an equitable solution for enhanced security in
