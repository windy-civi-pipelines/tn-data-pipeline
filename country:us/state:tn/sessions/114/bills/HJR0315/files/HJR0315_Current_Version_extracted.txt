HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 315
By Scarbrough
A RESOLUTION to recognize Hoskins Drug Store on the occasion
of its ninety-fifth anniversary.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly should recognize
those Tennessee businesses that have a longstanding commitment to providing exceptional
service to their customers; and
WHEREAS, one such esteemed business is Hoskins Drug Store in Clinton, which has
been owned and operated by the Hoskins family for the past ninety-five years; and
WHEREAS, opened in April 1930 by R.C. "Dudley" Hoskins, the original Hoskins Drug
Store was located on Market Street; over time, the store expanded to thirteen locations,
including its current location on Main Street, which opened in 1947; and
WHEREAS, now operated by Mr. Hoskins's daughters, Dudley Hoskins Bostic and
Mollie Hoskins Scarbrough, Hoskins Drug Store has witnessed many changes in the pharmacy
business since 1930, when drug compounding was the general practice and medicines came in
bags filled with powder; and
WHEREAS, a local landmark to generations of Anderson County residents, Hoskins
Drug Store's primary location, across from the Anderson County Courthouse in Clinton, draws
lawyers, politicians, and courthouse workers during the week at lunchtime with its soda fountain
and lunch counter; and
WHEREAS, Hoskins Drug Store continues to offer many of its original services,
including a full-service pharmacy, full medical supply, hot plate lunches, and an authentic soda
fountain that was custom-made for the drug store in the 1940s; and

WHEREAS, the drug store, which contains original wood fixtures and telephone booths
and is one of the few pharmacies in the South with its original soda fountain, was added to both
the National and Tennessee Register of Historic Places in 1998; and
WHEREAS, an independent drug store, Hoskins Drug Store has also strived to provide
top-of-the-line services, expanding its offerings to include immunizations, patient counseling,
medication therapy management services, and pharmacogenomics services; and
WHEREAS, Hoskins Drug Store's special attention to customer service over the years
has unquestionably contributed to the longevity of the business; and
WHEREAS, businesses such as Hoskins Drug Store are truly the backbone of American
society, as they combine the spirit of entrepreneurship with family values, honesty, and integrity;
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend Dudley Hoskins Bostic and Mollie Hoskins
Scarbrough, their employees, and the entire Hoskins family on the occasion of Hoskins Drug
Store's ninety-fifth anniversary, extending to these exemplary Tennesseans our best wishes for
much continued success and happiness.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
