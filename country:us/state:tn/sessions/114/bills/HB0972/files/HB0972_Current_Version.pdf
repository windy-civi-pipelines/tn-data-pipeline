clear of all liens and claims of ownership, must receive a sales receipt from the law
enforcement agency, and, upon presentation of the sales receipt, the department of
revenue shall issue a certificate of title to the purchaser.
(c) The sales receipt only is sufficient title for purposes of transferring the motor
vehicle to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking, or dismantling, and, in this case, further
titling of the motor vehicle is not necessary.
(d) The proceeds of the sale of an abandoned or immobile motor vehicle must
be used for payment of the expenses of the auction, the costs of towing, preserving, and
storing the abandoned or immobile motor vehicle, and all notice and publication costs,
including costs to post the motor vehicle on the motor vehicle portal, incurred pursuant to
§ 55-31-301 or § 55-31-302.
(e) Any remainder from the proceeds of a sale must be held by the law
enforcement agency for the owner of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for sixty (60)

remain available for the payment of auction, towing, preserving, storage, and all notice
and publication costs, including costs to post the motor vehicle on the motor vehicle

of its right to sell a vehicle taken into custody under this chapter in favor of a
garagekeeper in whose possession the vehicle was lawfully placed by the law
enforcement agency under this chapter. If a garagekeeper has made repairs to a
vehicle for which a waiver has been executed, then the garagekeeper may proceed to
enforce the lien as provided in § 66-19-103. If the garagekeeper has not made repairs
to a vehicle for which a waiver has been executed, then the garagekeeper may proceed
to sell the vehicle in accordance with the procedure established in § 55-31-303.
(b) As to third-party purchasers, the sale of the abandoned or immobile vehicle
is valid, but the garagekeeper shall sell the vehicle in a commercially reasonable
manner.

is lost or destroyed, or the reasons for the defect of title. The applicant must execute an
affidavit stating that the facts alleged therein are true and that no material fact has been
withheld.
(c) If the law enforcement agency finds that the application is executed in proper
form and shows that the motor vehicle has been abandoned or immobile upon the
property of the applicant, or if it shows that the motor vehicle is not reported stolen and is
not abandoned or immobile but that the applicant appears to be the rightful owner, then
the law enforcement agency shall follow the notification procedures set forth in § 55-31-
301 or § 55-31-302.
(d) If an abandoned or immobile motor vehicle is not reclaimed in accordance
with § 55-31-301 or § 55-31-302, then the law enforcement agency shall give the
applicant a certificate of authority to sell the motor vehicle to any demolisher for
demolition, wrecking, or dismantling. The demolisher shall accept the certificate in lieu
of the certificate of title to the motor vehicle.
(e) Notwithstanding this part to the contrary, a person upon whose property or in
whose possession is found an abandoned or immobile motor vehicle, or the owner of a
motor vehicle whose title certificate is faulty, lost, or destroyed, may dispose of the motor
vehicle to a demolisher without the motor vehicle's title and without the notification
procedures of § 55-31-301 or § 55-31-302, if the motor vehicle is over ten (10) years old
and has no engine or is otherwise totally inoperable.
