SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 435
By Briggs
A RESOLUTION to commemorate the 117th anniversary of the
U.S. Army Reserve.
WHEREAS, the contributions and sacrifices of the men and women who have served in
the United States Army Reserve since its inception in 1908 have been vital in maintaining our
freedoms and way of life; and
WHEREAS, the U.S. Army Reserve will celebrate its 117th birthday on April 23, 2025,
commemorating its establishment and more than a century of building and delivering combat-
ready soldiers and formations when the nation calls; and
WHEREAS, in an increasingly complex global environment, today's Army Reserve is a
critical component in supporting and sustaining the Army as it responds to acute threats from
across the globe; and
WHEREAS, the Army provides the bulk of sustainment forces to the Joint fight, and the
bulk of these capabilities reside in the Army Reserve, which means the Joint force cannot
deploy, fight, and win without the Army Reserve; and
WHEREAS, the Army Reserve stands ready to answer the call, providing critical
capabilities and ensuring the Army's readiness for every mission, helping the force meet any
challenge; and
WHEREAS, Army Reserve soldiers balance civilian life and military readiness,
embodying resilience, adaptability, and dedication to mission success; and
WHEREAS, reservists serve their country while also contributing to their communities
and civilian careers, embodying the strength and resilience of our nation; and

WHEREAS, the Army Reserve has a sizeable presence across the State of Tennessee,
with twelve facilities, 3,500 soldiers, and an annual economic impact exceeding $158 million;
and
WHEREAS, throughout the last 117 years since the inception of a federal reserve force,
citizen-soldiers have aided the Army and saved lives, proving that Army Reserve Soldiers
serving part time are integral to how the U.S. military operates; and
WHEREAS, it is most fitting that we pause to reflect on the important contributions and
sacrifices of those who have served in the United States Army Reserve since its founding; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we commemorate the United States Army Reserve's
