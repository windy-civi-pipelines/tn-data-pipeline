WHEREAS, Loretto's superb performance would not have been possible without the
expert guidance of Head Coach Greg Tipps and his assistant coaches, Bryce Glass, Colin

the unfailing support of the players' families, their fans, and their community; and

in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in competition
while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
