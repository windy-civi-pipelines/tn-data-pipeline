Luckadoo.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of Reverend Kenneth
Paul Luckadoo of Tazewell; and
WHEREAS, born on June 24, 1942, to Syllus Luckadoo and Shirley Luckadoo,
Reverend Kenneth Luckadoo, as a teenager, had already begun his journey in preaching before
he went off to attend Carson-Newman University for a year and then graduate from Lincoln
Memorial University; and
WHEREAS, ordained at Shawanee Baptist Church, Reverend Luckadoo began his first
pastorate in his early twenties, leading the people of Tazewell Baptist Church in godliness and

over fifty years, laying a cornerstone that will be built upon for years to come, and ultimately
retired with a full life of prayerful mission completed; and
WHEREAS, he was known as a man of God and led his people, both longtime believers
and those newly entering the fold, to discover the graces in this pilgrimage, and he confirmed
and comforted his people in faith, whether marking the new beginnings of baptisms or
commemorating at funerals those who have fallen asleep; and
WHEREAS, dedicated to serving those entrusted to him with a shepherd's care,
Reverend Luckadoo traveled 100 miles roundtrip to reach his congregation every Sunday; and

committed himself to fostering a love of learning and personal development in the impoverished
children he encountered, some of whom lacked even electricity; and
