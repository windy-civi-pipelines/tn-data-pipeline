Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 240
By Powers
A RESOLUTION to commemorate the celebration of St. Patrick's
Day.
WHEREAS, on March 17, the annual celebration of the Feast of Saint Patrick, Irish
Americans join with men, women, and children of all other ethnic origins who, for one day,
become Irish and celebrate both St. Patrick and their love of Ireland; and
WHEREAS, on St. Patrick's Day, all who wear the green live for a day in the spirit of the
three Patron Saints of Ireland, Saint Patrick, Saint Brigid, and Saint Colmcille; and
WHEREAS, Irish immigrants to Tennessee helped form the cultural foundation of this
State, and those Tennesseans of Irish lineage continue to proudly sing support for Ireland
today; and
WHEREAS, the songs of Ireland are the tragic songs of love and the joyous songs of
battle; they are the nostalgic reveries of the sorrows and glories that are the Emerald Isle, the
lamentations of life's myriad travails, and the odes to joy and the life eternal; and
WHEREAS, today, nearly one in ten Americans identify as being of Irish ancestry; Irish
immigrants helped build the America we know today, not only the physical infrastructure, but
also the political construct that is America; and
WHEREAS, the American War of Independence began in April 1775 at Lexington and
Concord, where "the shot heard 'round the world" continues to echo to this day; that action 250
years ago inspired Ireland and others in many nations to continue to struggle to be free and to
choose their own destiny; and

WHEREAS, the American-Irish relationship is a shining example of how ancestral ties,
historical connections, cultural affinities, and shared values can create a foundation for enduring
partnership and mutual prosperity; and
WHEREAS, Irish-American state legislators across the United States are playing a vitally
important role in fostering this partnership and ensuring that it continues and flourishes for
another century to come; and
WHEREAS, we are pleased to honor the American Irish State Legislators Caucus and
its aim of fostering and strengthening the longstanding relationship that exists between the
United States of America and the Republic of Ireland and mutually benefits both countries; and
WHEREAS, all Tennesseans are Irish on St. Patrick's Day, and as we wear the green
and sing Irish songs on this day of celebration, we most confidently state, "Erin go Bragh"; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we commemorate the celebration of St. Patrick's Day on March 17, the
annual celebration of the Feast of Saint Patrick, the Patron Saint of Ireland.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
