SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 444
By Johnson
A RESOLUTION to commemorate "FTD Awareness Week,"
September 21-28, 2025, in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) reports that
Frontotemporal Degeneration (FTD) is a terminal and incurable neurodegenerative disease
affecting the frontal and temporal lobes, causing impairments to speech, personality, behavior,
and motor skills, which constitutes a major public health concern; and
WHEREAS, while there has never been a global epidemiology study of FTD, it is
estimated that more than 60,000 people are affected in the United States today; and
WHEREAS, AFTD is the leading national organization exclusively focused on the
spectrum of FTD disorders with a mission to improve the quality of life for people affected by
FTD and drive research to a cure; and
WHEREAS, an accurate diagnosis of FTD takes an average of 3.6 years from the start
of symptoms, with an average life expectancy of between seven and thirteen years after the
start of symptoms; and
WHEREAS, FTD may strike people between the ages of twenty-one and eighty, with the
largest percentage of those affected being between forty-five and sixty-four years of age,
rendering people in the prime of life unable to work or function normally; and
WHEREAS, FTD imposes average annual costs associated with care and living with the
disease that are approximately double those of Alzheimer's disease; and
WHEREAS, FTD represents an estimated five to fifteen percent of all dementia cases
and is the most common form of dementia for people under sixty years of age; and

WHEREAS, approximately forty percent of people with FTD have a family history of FTD
or a related condition such as ALS, with about half of those found to have an inherited form
accounted for by mutations in the Progranulin, C9orf72, Tau/MAPT, and other rarer genes; and
WHEREAS, FTD is often misdiagnosed as a psychiatric problem or other
neurodegenerative disease because of the wide range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms
and their onset at an early age; and
WHEREAS, FTD often affects a person's ability to express emotions and to show
affection and empathy for loved ones; and
WHEREAS, in the behavioral variant of FTD, a person's sense of social graces and
appropriate behavior can be lost, and their personality may be significantly changed; and
WHEREAS, furthermore, in the language variants of FTD (primary progressive aphasia),
a person may have trouble producing speech and understanding grammar, lose the meaning of
words or become hesitant in speech, and may eventually become mute; and
WHEREAS, in the movement variants of FTD, a person may experience muscle
weakness, falling, loss of balance, difficulty making speech, difficulty swallowing, or choking;
and
WHEREAS, it is important that we help bring greater awareness of this serious disease
to the residents of Tennessee; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we commemorate the week of September 21-28,
2025, as "FTD Awareness Week" in the State of Tennessee.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
