HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 41
By Behn
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of John Randall "Randy"
Rayburn.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of John Randall "Randy"
Rayburn; and
WHEREAS, Randy Rayburn was an exemplary public servant and consummate
professional who worked assiduously to improve the quality of life for his fellow citizens in
numerous capacities; and
WHEREAS, the son of Charles Guy and Kathleen Butler Rayburn, Randy Rayburn was
born on January 24, 1950, in Memphis and grew up in nearby Milan; and
WHEREAS, after finishing his degree at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, he
discovered the expansive and inviting social scene of Nashville, where he quickly became a
central figure in both political and culinary matters; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Rayburn acted as a nexus for the various social circles and spheres that
inhabited Nashville in the 1970s and 1980s, and his parties atop Squirrel Hill, populated by
members of his "New Trashvillians" guest list, became legendary for their scope and hospitality;
and
WHEREAS, a lifelong Democrat and active political entity, Mr. Rayburn became known
both for his skills as an information broker in the restaurant scene and for his sealed lips
concerning the more sensitive matters of his clientele; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Rayburn worked for more than ten restaurants in Nashville before
deciding he would utilize his experience, talent, and insight to create his own restaurant, Sunset
Grill, in 1990; and

WHEREAS, Sunset Grill instantiated Mr. Rayburn's well-known and beloved presence; it
became a landmark of the city where high quality conversation, characters, and cuisine could
always be delighted in, and some 800 people a day were served; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Rayburn's farseeing vision for Sunset Grill can be seen in its pivot to
California-inspired cuisine and American eclecticism over rarified fine dining and in such
innovations as wine-by-the-glass and outdoor patio dining, which are now staples of the
Nashville dining scene; and
WHEREAS, he successfully managed Sunset Grill while opening and maintaining two
other renowned restaurants in the city, Cabana and Midtown Cafe, but seeing the changing
desires of the market, Mr. Rayburn decided to close Sunset Grill's doors in 2014; and
WHEREAS, while COVID-19 put a heavy strain on restaurants and marked the end of
Cabana, Mr. Rayburn seized an opportunity to help jumpstart the Elliston Place Soda Shop by
enlisting his coworker of thirty-seven years, former general manager of Sunset Grill, and
business partner in Cabana, Craig Clifft, to run the new venture, and both Midtown Cafe and
Elliston Place Soda Shop continue to thrive after the pandemic; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Rayburn maintained a loving friendship to the famous Tennessean
publisher John Seigenthaler, who frequented Sunset Grill and Midtown Cafe, and Mr. Rayburn
kept a portrait of his friend hanging in Midtown Cafe to honor him; and
WHEREAS, outside of his career as a restaurateur, Mr. Rayburn was renowned for his
generosity to those in need, his impressive consumption of the written word, and his profound
capacity for kindness; and
WHEREAS, he was also deeply devoted to his family, and he had an obvious and
admirable devotion to his two sons, Duke and Dean, often expressing his wish that he had
become a father sooner; and

their mother, Sonata Stanton Helbig; cousins, Jimmy Lee Trobaugh and Charlotte Brownlee;
and other family members; and

public life, compassion and loyalty in private life, and diligence and dedication in all his chosen
endeavors; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should remember the bountiful life of this exceptional
gentleman and human being; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of John Randall "Randy" Rayburn, reflecting fondly
