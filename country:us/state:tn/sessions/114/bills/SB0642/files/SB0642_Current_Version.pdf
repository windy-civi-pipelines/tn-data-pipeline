(b) A person may file a voluntary waiver of firearm rights form, either in person or

was received, the clerk shall transmit the accepted form to the Tennessee bureau of
investigation (TBI). The TBI shall provide the department of safety with a copy of the
enrollment form within forty-eight (48) hours of receiving a form. If the person has a
handgun carry permit issued pursuant to § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366, then the
department of safety shall suspend the person's permit.
(c) The TBI shall enter the voluntary waiver of firearm rights form into the
national instant criminal background check system and other federal or state computer-

based systems used by law enforcement agencies to identify prohibited purchasers of
firearms within twenty-four (24) hours of receipt of the form.
(d) No sooner than seven (7) calendar days after filing a voluntary waiver of
firearm rights form, the person may file a revocation of the voluntary waiver of firearm
rights form, either in writing or electronically, with the clerk of any circuit court, which has
the effect of permitting the person executing the form to possess or receive a firearm
after the TBI has completed processing the revocation form and twenty-one (21)
calendar days have passed since the TBI's receipt of the revocation form, unless the
person is otherwise ineligible to purchase or possess a firearm under federal or state
law. The clerk shall request a physical or scanned copy of valid government-issued
photo identification to verify the person's identity prior to accepting the revocation form.
By the end of the business day on which the revocation form was received, the clerk
shall transmit the revocation form to the TBI and destroy all records related to the
person's voluntary waiver of firearm rights form and revocation of voluntary waiver of
firearm rights form. Twenty-one (21) calendar days after receiving a revocation of
voluntary waiver of firearm rights form, the TBI shall remove the person from the national
instant criminal background check system and other federal or state computer-based
systems used by law enforcement to identify prohibited purchasers of firearms in which
the person's voluntary waiver of firearm rights form was entered, unless the person is
otherwise ineligible to purchase or possess a firearm under federal or state law. The TBI
shall destroy all records related to the person's voluntary waiver of firearm rights and
revocation of voluntary waiver of firearm rights after removing the person from the
national instant criminal background check system and other federal or state

(g) Records obtained and produced under this section are confidential and are
not an open record pursuant to title 10, chapter 7, except that such information may be
disclosed to a law enforcement officer acting in the performance of the officer's official
duties, in the course of a criminal prosecution, or to the applicant with respect to the
