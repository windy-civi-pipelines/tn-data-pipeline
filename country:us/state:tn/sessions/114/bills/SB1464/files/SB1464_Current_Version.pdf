AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4;
Title 5; Title 6; Title 7; Title 8; Title 10; Title 38;
Title 39; Title 40; Title 41 and Chapter 253 of the
Public Acts of 2021, relative to confidential
records.
WHEREAS, the General Assembly finds that maintaining confidentiality of personal
identifying information of federal, state, and local officers, agents, and officials engaged in the
enforcement of federal and State immigration laws and sensitive information related to
immigration enforcement operations in this State is paramount to the protection and safety of
such officers, agents, and officials, the integrity of such enforcement operations, and public
safety; and
WHEREAS, the confidential maintenance of such information protects such persons
from targeted harassment, threats, or violence due to their enforcement duties; prevents
disclosure of sensitive information that could compromise immigration enforcement operations;
maintains the public confidence in immigration enforcement activities by ensuring such persons
can effectively carry out their duties without fear of retaliation; and aligns with existing privacy
laws to protect federal and State law enforcement officers' and employees' personal identifying
information; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
