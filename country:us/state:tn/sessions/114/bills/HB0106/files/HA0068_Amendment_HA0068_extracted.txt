section, unless the department determines upon clear and convincing evidence that the

to determine if the program or activity is clearly distinguishable from child care services
typically regulated by the department and otherwise qualifies for exemption from
licensing:
(1) The sole or primary purpose of the program or activity is to provide
specialized opportunities for the child's educational, social, cultural, religious, or
athletic development, or to provide the child with mental or physical health
services;
(2) The time period in which the program or activity provides these
opportunities is consistent with a reasonable time period for the completion of the
- 9 - 004781
program or activity, considering the age of each child served and the nature of
the program;
(3) The primary purpose of the program or activity is not routinely
available or could not be made routinely available in the typical child care
settings regulated by the department;
(4) Parents could reasonably be expected to choose the program or
activity because of the unique nature of what it offers, rather than as a substitute
for full-time, before- or after-school, holiday, or weather-related child care; and
(5) If the program or activity is regulated by any other federal, state, or
local agency, it is required by such other agency to comply with standards that
substantially meet or exceed department licensing regulations.
(d)
(1) All exempt programs, except those programs or categories of care
exempt under subdivisions (b)(1)โ(4), (7), and (13)โ(15), must:
(A) Register intent to operate as an exempt program or activity
with the department in a manner and form as the department may
require, including that the request must contain a detailed description of
the operation of the program or activity, the program's or activity's
purpose, and the applicant's basis for claiming an exemption;
(B) Post a sign stating: "This facility is not required to be licensed
by the state as a child care agency.";
(C)
(i) Require that when a parent, custodian, or guardian
initially registers a child with an exempt program, the parent,
custodian, or guardian must sign a form indicating that the parent,
custodian, or guardian has been advised and understands that the
- 10 - 004781
program is not licensed and is not required to be licensed by the
state as a child care agency; and
(ii) Maintain the signed form with the records of the
exempt entity; and
(2) The department shall provide a written response to the exemption
request described in subdivision (d)(1)(A) stating the reasons the exemption was
granted or denied.
(e)
(1) The department is not required to grant exemptions to programs or
activities that offer otherwise exempt opportunities or services as a mere
component of a program or activity that the department determines primarily
constitutes child care.
(2) A program or activity is not exempt from licensing solely for the
reason that the care and supervision of children that constitutes child care is
offered only on a part-time or periodic basis.
(3) Exemption from licensure does not exempt the program or activity
from compliance with any other local, state, or federal requirements.
(f) A program or activity that falls within the definition of a child care agency, but
has been determined to be exempt under one (1) of the categories of exempt care in
subsection (b), upon failure to comply with any of the criteria required under the
applicable category of exempt care, is no longer exempt and, therefore, is subject to the
licensing requirements of this part.

(5) If the program or activity is regulated by any other federal, state, or
local agency, it is required by such other agency to comply with standards that
substantially meet or exceed department licensing regulations.
(d)
(1) All exempt programs, except those programs or categories of care
exempt under subdivisions (b)(1)โ(4), (7), and (13)โ(15), must:
(A) Register intent to operate as an exempt program or activity
with the department in a manner and form as the department may
require, including that the request must contain a detailed description of
the operation of the program or activity, the program's or activity's
purpose, and the applicant's basis for claiming an exemption;
(B) Post a sign stating: "This facility is not required to be licensed
by the state as a child care agency.";
(C)
(i) Require that when a parent, custodian, or guardian
initially registers a child with an exempt program, the parent,
custodian, or guardian must sign a form indicating that the parent,
custodian, or guardian has been advised and understands that the

program is not licensed and is not required to be licensed by the
state as a child care agency; and
(ii) Maintain the signed form with the records of the
exempt entity; and
(2) The department shall provide a written response to the exemption
request described in subdivision (d)(1)(A) stating the reasons the exemption was
granted or denied.
(e)
(1) The department is not required to grant exemptions to programs or
activities that offer otherwise exempt opportunities or services as a mere
component of a program or activity that the department determines primarily
constitutes child care.
(2) A program or activity is not exempt from licensing solely for the
reason that the care and supervision of children that constitutes child care is
offered only on a part-time or periodic basis.
(3) Exemption from licensure does not exempt the program or activity
from compliance with any other local, state, or federal requirements.
(f) A program or activity that falls within the definition of a child care agency, but
has been determined to be exempt under one (1) of the categories of exempt care in
subsection (b), upon failure to comply with any of the criteria required under the
applicable category of exempt care, is no longer exempt and, therefore, is subject to the
licensing requirements of this part.
