by deleting all language after the caption and substituting:
WHEREAS, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program
tracks both the violent crime rate and the solve rate or clearance rate of those violent crimes
across the country and in this State; and
WHEREAS, this State can use that data to better understand what drives both crime and
deterrence in Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, the violent crime rate rose almost eighteen percent (18%) in the ten year
period from 2013 to 2023; and
WHEREAS, during that same time period, the rate of homicide offenses more than
doubled (110%), the rate of aggravated assault offenses rose thirty percent (30%), the rate of
robbery offenses fell by almost a third (31%), and the rate of rape offenses rose seven percent
(7%); and
WHEREAS, meanwhile, the rate of violent crimes that went unsolved rose eleven
percent (11%); and
WHEREAS, in 2023, the clearance rate was only thirty-nine percent (39%), meaning that
sixty-one percent (61%) of violent crimes were unsolved; now, therefore,
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 38, Chapter 8, is amended by adding
the following as a new part:
38-8-401. Short title.
HA0340
005472
- 1 -

This part is known and may be cited as the "Tennessee Violent Incident
Clearance and Technological Investigative Methods Support (TN-VICTIMS) Act."
38-8-402. Findings.
The general assembly finds:
(1) Low clearance rates undermine efforts to hold perpetrators accountable,
disrupt cycles of violence, and provide justice to victims;
(2) Agencies within the criminal justice system need additional resources and
support to strengthen investigations, apply community problem-solving approaches to
violent crime hotspots, and implement programs that blend law enforcement, social
services, and community mobilization strategies;
(3) Research shows that enhanced investigative resources, improved
management structures, and oversight processes can increase clearance rates and
improve the chances that perpetrators are apprehended in even the most difficult cases
to clear;
(4) Research also shows that increasing the perceived likelihood of
apprehension and punishment is one (1) of the most effective methods to deter crime;
and
(5) Therefore, each dollar spent on increasing the likelihood of being arrested for
committing a crime will reduce crime rates in this state.
38-8-403. Part definitions.
As used in this part:
(1) "Academy" means the Jerry F. Agee Tennessee law enforcement training
academy, created pursuant to part 2 of this chapter;
(2) "Bureau" means the Tennessee bureau of investigation, created pursuant to
chapter 6 of this title;
(3) "Commission" means the Tennessee peace officer standards and training
commission, created pursuant to part 1 of this chapter;
- 2 - 005472

(4) "Eligible agencies" means any law enforcement agency or office of a district
attorney general in this state; and
(5) "Violent crime" means the same as defined in the federal bureau of

38-8-404. Violent crime clearance grants.
(a) Subject to appropriation by the general assembly for this purpose, the
department of finance and administration, office of criminal justice programs, in
consultation with the commission, the academy, and the bureau, shall develop a grant
program for eligible agencies to improve strategies and initiatives aimed at increasing
violent crime clearance rates and engagement and support for victims of violent crime.
(b) All eligible agencies that receive funding under this section shall report to the
office of criminal justice programs annually on activities carried out using grant dollars
during the preceding fiscal year.
38-8-405. Repealer.
This part is repealed on July 1, 2031, unless reenacted or extended by the general
assembly prior to that date.
SECTION 2. This act is not an appropriation of funds, and funds must not be obligated
or expended pursuant to this act unless the funds are specifically appropriated by the general
appropriations act.
SECTION 3. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
