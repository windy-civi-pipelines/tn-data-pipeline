Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 152
By Jones J
A RESOLUTION to recognize and honor the fifteen enslaved
persons who helped build the Tennessee State
Capitol.
WHEREAS, it is most fitting, especially as we commemorate Black History Month, to
honor the lives and indelible contributions of those Tennesseans whose names might otherwise
be lost to time; and
WHEREAS, between the spring of 1846 and January 1847, fifteen enslaved Nashvillians
were rented by the State government to complete an early phase of construction of the State
Capitol; twelve names of these fifteen individuals have been ascertained through historical
record: Lewis, Daniel, Robert, Nelson, John, Parker, Dang, Bill, John G., John, Andrew, and
Jim; and
WHEREAS, the site of the Capitol was a large limestone formation covered with a thin
layer of soil; these fifteen men came to the construction project after the soil was removed and
the heavy limestone beneath remained, using picks and crowbars to break the rock and carrying
it away on flatbed wheel barrows; and
WHEREAS, these men were undoubtedly skilled laborers, as indicated by the task itself,
that of carving the Capitol's cellar to exact specifications, and by the price that A.G. Payne was
paid for their work: $18.00 per month, per enslaved person, which was more than double the
typical rate and nearly double the rate for unskilled free labor; and
WHEREAS, for fourteen years, until the death of A.G. Payne, these fifteen men worked
at both a farm and brick factory, the monotony briefly punctuated by being hired out; they
remained with his widow until their emancipation in 1865; and

WHEREAS, the men did not have the option of becoming sharecroppers on the land that
Payne owned, as it was sold off to satisfy debts of the estate, but they may have been able to
put their training and skills to use; and
WHEREAS, in the end, however, the former enslaved persons who had helped construct
the Capitol found themselves in the same position as four million other newly emancipated
individuals—empowered by their freedom but ultimately limited in employment due to what the
South would soon become in terms of race relations; and
WHEREAS, the enslaved men who participated in the construction of the Capitol made a
significant contribution to their State and country that Tennesseans appreciate to this day;
knowing the story of these individuals adds to both the history of the Capitol and the broad topic
of slavery's impact in Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, by accepting the unfortunate irony that slavery was used to construct a
building meant for the purpose of democracy, we can truly appreciate how far that democracy
has come in the time since these enslaved persons left their mark on history; as the
beneficiaries of their work, we must afford them the correct and appropriate recognition they
earned over a century and a half ago; and
WHEREAS, for too long, these fifteen individuals have not been given proper
recognition, and it is our privilege and duty to rectify this dereliction and duly credit the skilled
men who helped create one of our State's most treasured landmarks; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we recognize and honor the memories and legacies of the fifteen enslaved
persons, including Lewis, Daniel, Robert, Nelson, John, Parker, Dang, Bill, John G., John,
Andrew, and Jim, whose skilled labor helped build the Tennessee State Capitol.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
