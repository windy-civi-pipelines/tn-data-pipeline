(2) "Litter" means refuse that is not contained or disposed of in accordance with
the provisions of this Act.

dead animals, abandoned automobiles, and market and industrial wastes; and
SECTION 2. It is unlawful for any person to place, leave, dump, or permit to accumulate

SECTION 3. All household refuse putouts shall be made in closed containers and
secured in such a way as to prevent the contents from escaping therefrom and circulating freely
in the environment; wet garbage shall be drained and placed in waterproof containers (e.g.,
plastic garbage bags). Toxic or hazardous substances are prohibited from being placed in
these containers.

SECTION 5. The maintenance of a litter-free environment at all construction and
demolition sites shall be the responsibility of the owners, contractors, and subcontractors
thereof. All refuse shall be removed from the site frequently enough to preclude a litter problem.
SECTION 6. All loading and unloading docks shall be maintained in such a manner as
to prevent refuse from accumulating and from circulating freely in the environment. The
responsibility for such maintenance shall devolve upon the owners and lessees thereof.
SECTION 7. All owners of private dwellings, or their lessees, shall be responsible for
seeing to the maintenance of a litter-free environment in the areas immediately surrounding said
dwellings up to the adjacent public street or road. Obnoxious growth shall be removed.
SECTION 8. All vacant lots within the county municipalities shall be kept clean and free
of litter by the owners or lessees thereof. Obnoxious growth shall be removed.
SECTION 9. The county landfill shall be the sole ultimate repository of all refuse. All
other dumpsites, other than provisional municipal dumpsites, are accordingly prohibited. Such
provisions shall not prohibit persons from disposing of their own solid waste upon their own
lands provided such disposal does not create a public nuisance, health hazard, or unsightly
condition.
SECTIO 10. With respect to publicly maintained dumpsters, there shall be no burning of
refuse and no scavenging. Refuse shall not be deposited outside the dumpsters. If a dumpster
is full, the refuse will be taken to another dumpster that is not full. Large, heavy items as well as
hazardous materials and large pieces of wood are prohibited from being placed in or in the
vicinity of a dumpster.
SECTION 11. Political and commercial posters or other advertisements shall not be
placed upon public property or right-of-way, including utility and telephone poles. Handbills and
like advertisements shall be distributed in such a manner as to prevent their circulating freely in
the environment. These items will not be placed on the outside of vehicles, homes, or
businesses where they would create a litter hazard.

to prevent loss of material upon public roads, rights-of-way, or other public or private property.

tobacco items, and other personal use items that could be considered litter.
SECTION 18. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to dump refuse in
any form into any stream, ditch, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, or other drain within the County of
Tipton. This does not preclude properly prepared putrescible wastes from domestic "garbage
grinders" discharging into sanitary sewers.

sidewalks, or other public place within the County of Tipton, except in public receptacles or in
authorized private receptacles for collection or in the Tipton County landfill.
SECTION 20. If an object of litter is discovered on another person's property without
such person's permission, on any public highway, street or road, upon public parks or recreation
areas, or upon any other public property except that property designated for that use, bearing a
person's name, it shall be prima facie evidence that the person whose name appears on the
object threw, dumped, or deposited it there.
