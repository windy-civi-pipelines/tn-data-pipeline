AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 3,
Chapter 6 and Title 4, relative to agents of foreign
entities.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
SECTION 1. Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 3, Chapter 6, is amended by adding the

The general assembly finds that:

transparency in the political and propaganda activities of organizations that may
be controlled by or under the influence of foreign countries hostile to the interests

(2) In an increasingly globalized world, determining whether an
organization's political and propaganda activities are funded by hostile foreign
interests is often difficult; and
(3) Legislation is needed to ensure the transparency necessary to allow
voters, citizens, and policymakers to evaluate whether political and propaganda
activities are funded by potentially hostile foreign actors.
