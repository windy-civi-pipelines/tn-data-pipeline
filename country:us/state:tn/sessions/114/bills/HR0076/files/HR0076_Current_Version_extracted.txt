Section 1:
HOUSE RESOLUTION 76
By Behn
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Sallamaari Vainio on the
occasion of receiving her United States
citizenship.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this body should recognize those individuals
whose lives and accomplishments remind us of the enduring strength of this nation—our
immigrant roots and the people who continue to choose America as their home; and
WHEREAS, Sallamaari Vainio, a native of Finland, has recently completed the rigorous
process of becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States, and her journey stands as a
testament to the enduring promise of America: that we are not defined by where we come from,
but by the values we share and the communities we build together; and
WHEREAS, throughout her time in this country, Ms. Vainio has brought with her a deep
respect for civic life, an unwavering belief in democracy, and a fierce love for freedom—values
that align not only with the American spirit, but enrich it; and
WHEREAS, immigrants like Sallamaari Vainio are not only dreamers of the American
Dream—they are builders of it. From small towns to big cities, from classrooms to kitchens to
clinics, immigrants have always kept this country going, growing, and evolving. They are our
neighbors, our coworkers, our friends, and our family; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee is made stronger, more dynamic, and more hopeful because of
the immigrants who call it home. At a time when some seek to divide us by fear or fiction, it is
imperative we lift up the truth: that immigrants are not a threat to America—they are a reflection
of it; and

WHEREAS, by choosing to become a citizen, Sallamaari Vainio has made an enduring
commitment to our shared future. She now joins the long, proud lineage of those who crossed
oceans and borders to be part of this experiment in liberty and justice for all; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor and
commend Sallamaari Vainio on the occasion of receiving her United States citizenship,
welcome her as a fellow citizen with full rights and dignity, and recognize her as a powerful
reminder of what truly makes this country great: the people who choose it, believe in it, and
work to make it better.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.
