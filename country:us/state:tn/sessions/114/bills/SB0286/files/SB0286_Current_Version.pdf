SECTION 2. Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 56-26-204, is amended by deleting
subsections (b) and (c) and substituting:

formed under the laws of this state or another state from offering health insurance
coverage to its members within this state, including through a multiple employer welfare
arrangement, if the health insurance coverage complies with federal law. To the extent
deemed necessary by the commissioner, each employer member of the approved group
must be classified as a self-insurer as otherwise provided in this chapter.
(c) A pool created or deemed domestic under this section is subject to taxation
under chapter 4 of this title, filing and approval under this chapter, and laws for
protection of policyholders under chapter 7 of this title.
SECTION 3. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
