WHEREAS, opened in 2015, the 550-foot boardwalk and aviary complex at Radnor Lake

housed and cared for at Radnor Lake State Park; and

prey and provide the highest level of care for the park's captive wildlife and high-quality
interpretive birds-of-prey programs for the public; and
WHEREAS, there are seven non-releasable birds in residence at the Barbara J. Mapp
Aviary Education Center: a great horned owl, a red-tailed hawk, a vulture, a golden eagle, and

their individual needs and to offer protection; and
