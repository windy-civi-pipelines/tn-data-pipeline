HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 86
By Hemmer
A RESOLUTION to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of Dolly
Parton's Imagination Library.
WHEREAS, in 1995, country music legend Dolly Parton founded the Imagination Library
in her native Sevier County, Tennessee, to fulfill her dream of helping children fall in love with
books and reading; and
WHEREAS, thirty years later, we are celebrating an innovative program that has
motivated thousands of children nationwide to identify as readers and build their own personal
library of books; and
WHEREAS, inspired by the memory of her father, whose reading skills were limited,
Dolly Parton launched Imagination Library by gifting age-appropriate books each month to
nearly 2,000 local children from birth to age five; and
WHEREAS, in 2004, then-Governor Phil Bredesen partnered with the Imagination
Library and expanded the program statewide; today, Imagination Library ships books to children
in all fifty states, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland; and
WHEREAS, more than 260 million books have been gifted by Imagination Library to
date, and the program continues to grow; and
WHEREAS, Dolly Parton has earned the affectionate sobriquet "The Book Lady" from a
legion of grateful young readers, and Imagination Library remains the brightest star in her
shining legacy of philanthropy; and
WHEREAS, her inspired efforts to promote children's literacy and education through
Imagination Library have reaped huge dividends, as a study has shown that children who are
participants of the program are better prepared for kindergarten and score significantly higher
on reading comprehension and vocabulary assessments; and
