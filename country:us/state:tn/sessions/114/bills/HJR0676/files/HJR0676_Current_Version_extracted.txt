Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 676
By Reeves
A RESOLUTION to honor the legendary country music band
Sawyer Brown on the occasion of their fortieth
anniversary.
WHEREAS, Sawyer Brown, formed in Apopka, Florida, in 1981 by Mark Miller, Gregg
"Hobie" Hubbard, Bobby Randall, Joe "Curly" Smyth, and Jim Scholten, emerged from Don
King's road band and went on to become one of the most influential and enduring acts in
country music history; and
WHEREAS, the band rose to national prominence in 1984 by winning the inaugural
season of Star Search with Ed McMahon, captivating America with their electrifying
performances and taking home the $100,000 grand prize and a recording contract with Capitol
Records; and
WHEREAS, the band—whose sound was compared to country supergroups like
Alabama and the Charlie Daniels Band, yet whose look echoed the raw energy of the Rolling
Stones and Aerosmith—blazed their own path in the music industry, combining a high-energy
stage presence with a distinct "life songs" ethos rather than traditional love songs; and
WHEREAS, their breakout hit "Leona" in 1984 was soon followed by their first No.1
single, "Step That Step," beginning a remarkable run of over fifty charted singles on the
Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, including additional No. 1 hits like "Some Girls Do" and
"Thank God for You"; and
WHEREAS, throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the band evolved musically, moving from
country-pop to more meaningful ballads, and released a string of successful albums including
The Dirt Road, Café on the Corner, and Outskirts of Town, many under their longtime label,
Curb Records; and

WHEREAS, Sawyer Brown has performed over 6,000 shows, released twenty-four
albums and thirty-six videos, and earned eleven major industry awards, including honors from
the CMA, ACM, and CMT, as well as the 1985 CMA Horizon Award and Vocal Group of the
Year in 1997 from the Academy of Country Music; and
WHEREAS, they have shared stages with legendary artists, including Kenny Rogers,
Dolly Parton, the Beach Boys, Ray Charles, and KC of the Sunshine Band, influencing the next
generation of stars such as Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, Dierks Bentley, and Kenny Chesney;
and
WHEREAS, Sawyer Brown continues to connect with fans across generations,
performing for audiences that now span parents, children, and grandparents alike, creating a
unique multi-generational bond through music; and
WHEREAS, 2024 marks the fortieth anniversary of their Star Search victory and the
launch of an iconic career, which is being celebrated through a forthcoming memoir by Mark
Miller, a documentary on the band, and a new album co-produced with Blake Shelton; now,
therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we recognize and honor Sawyer Brown for four decades of excellence in
music, innovation in the country-rock genre, and unwavering dedication to their fans and craft.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we commend the band's remarkable journey from
underdogs to industry icons and celebrate the legacy they continue to build, one unforgettable
show at a time.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
