HOUSE BILL 325
By Bulso
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 15,
Chapter 2, relative to special days of observance.
WHEREAS, Father Charles Frederick Strobel was a Nashville native, grew up in the
Germantown neighborhood, and fostered deep connections within the community and churches
in the area; and
WHEREAS, Father Strobel believed in living his faith on a daily basis, pulling inspiration
from the Sermon on the Mount, among other holy texts and divine inspirations; and
WHEREAS, upon becoming a priest, Father Strobel quickly and effectively set his sights
on bettering the lives of the homeless and impoverished by opening up a school for homeless
people so they could have a warm place to stay at a time when endemic poverty and other
social concerns were impacting Tennessee and the nation as a whole; and
WHEREAS, Father Strobel founded the Room in the Inn, a sanctuary opened in a
church parking lot in the winter of 1985; and
WHEREAS, the Room in the Inn has since blossomed into a national model for assisting
the homeless, with over 200 congregations and 7,000 volunteers that shelter nearly 1,500
individuals from November 1 to March 31 of each season; and
WHEREAS, this state seeks to honor Father Strobel and how he combatted
homelessness to enact positive change, and created programs for the homeless that have
become a successful model for the entire nation; now, therefore
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE:
