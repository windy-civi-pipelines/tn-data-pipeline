by the majestic cypress forest is unlike any other waterbody in the state; and
WHEREAS, Reelfoot Lake historically supported the region's growth by providing a
reliable source of irrigation to the agriculture industry; and
WHEREAS, it is home to rare and diverse aquatic and wildlife species, and
WHEREAS, in 1966, Reelfoot Lake was designated a National Natural Landmark by the
U.S. Department of Interior and the National Park Service; and
WHEREAS, in 1956, certain areas of the lake were designated as a state park; and
WHEREAS, in 1973, Reelfoot Lake was designated as a state natural area; and
WHEREAS, the lake celebrates a long history of hunting and fishing, supporting habitat
for rare and diverse aquatic and wildlife species, and is a celebrated breeding and habitat area
for the great American bald eagle and over 200 other migratory birds; and
WHEREAS, Reelfoot Lake is part of the 24,000 acre Reelfoot Wildlife Management
Area, attracting over 750,000 people a year to enjoy what is considered top-ranking waterfowl
hunting in the Mississippi Flyway; and
