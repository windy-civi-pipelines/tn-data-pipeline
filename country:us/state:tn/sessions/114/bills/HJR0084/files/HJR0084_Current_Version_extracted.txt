Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 84
By Vital
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Tennessee
Department of Transportation and Project
Milkweed.
WHEREAS, the population of monarch butterflies has been dwindling for decades as the
pollinator's sole source of food and habitat, milkweed, has drastically declined since 1992; and
WHEREAS, in June 2022, the International Union for Conservation of Nature announced
the monarch butterfly had joined the Red List of Threatened Species as Endangered; this
marked the first time it had officially been declared at risk of extinction, according to a report
from the Monarch Joint Venture, which is a partnership focused on protecting monarch
migration across the United States; and
WHEREAS, understanding the importance of this vital pollinator, the Tennessee
Department of Transportation (TDOT) initiated Project Milkweed, which provides milkweed
seeds to the public for planting; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee residents are able to choose red milkweed, a native perennial
found in swamps, river bottomlands, and wet meadows, and common milkweed, another native
perennial found in fields, open woods, and roadsides; and
WHEREAS, in 2023, TDOT distributed 780,000 milkweed seed packets to requesting
participants in an effort to restore landscapes and preserve habitats for pollinator species,
including the monarch butterfly; and
WHEREAS, a year later, TDOT launched its Milkweed Giveaway during National
Pollinator Week, distributing 350,000 available seed packets, which the agency believes is a
sustainable target that allows it to balance budget with demand from the public; and

WHEREAS, orders can be placed for up to three seed packets, with each packet
containing twenty seeds; one order is allowed per person or household, and shipping is
restricted to addresses in Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we recognize this tremendous initiative to ensure the survival
of the monarch butterfly and the vital pollinators that help to make Tennessee the greenest state
in the land of the free and the home of the brave; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we hereby honor and commend the Tennessee Department of
Transportation and Project Milkweed on their efforts to restore the monarch butterfly population
in the State of Tennessee.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
