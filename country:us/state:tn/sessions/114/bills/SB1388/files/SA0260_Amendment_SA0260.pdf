(b) Notwithstanding this part to the contrary, the department shall establish and
implement by rule a process for self-employment and entrepreneurship that provides an
eligible individual with a disability the opportunity, as part of the individual's IPE, to be
trained and licensed to operate vending facilities on public properties for which the
department has first priority pursuant to this part, but where licensed blind vending
facility operators through the business enterprise program for the blind have chosen not
to operate at such vending facilities or at such vending facilities that are not generating
unassigned income pursuant to ยง 71-4-504 on the effective date of this act. However,
the department shall continue to retain first preference for operating vending facilities on
public property for licensed blind vending facility operators, and shall assign second
preference for operating such facilities to licensed non-blind eligible individuals with
disabilities pursuant to the department's priority established under this part.
(c) The department shall include a process for receiving and investigating
complaints from public property management regarding the conduct or performance of a
non-blind eligible individual with a disability who operates a vending facility on such
public property.
(d)
(1) Funding for the goods, services, initial stock, or other regular
business expenses approved by the department for a licensed non-blind eligible
individual with a disability to operate a vending facility must be provided in
accordance with the individual's IPE.
(2) In accordance with the Randolph-Sheppard Act (20 U.S.C. ยง 107 et
seq.), funds used for licensed blind vending facility operators through the
business enterprise program for the blind, including set-aside, unassigned, and
business enterprise program funds, must not be used for licensed non-blind
eligible individuals with disabilities who operate a vending facility pursuant to this
section.

(e) When a licensed non-blind eligible individual with a disability ceases to
operate a vending facility on a public property pursuant to this section, the department
shall first determine whether licensed blind vending facility operators through the
business enterprise program for the blind continue to choose not to operate the vending
facility before assigning the vending facility to another licensed non-blind eligible
individual with a disability.
SECTION 2. The department shall promulgate rules to effectuate this act. The rules
must be promulgated in accordance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled
in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4, Chapter 5.
SECTION 3. This act takes effect upon becoming a law, the public welfare requiring it.
