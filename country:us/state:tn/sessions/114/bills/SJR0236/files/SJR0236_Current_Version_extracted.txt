A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Knoxville Webb Lady
Spartans girls' basketball team upon winning the
Division II-AA state tournament.

who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and

team of Webb School of Knoxville, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest

tournament; and
WHEREAS, after earning a bye in the first round, the Lady Spartans demolished
Briarcrest 72-54 in the quarterfinals to advance in their quest for the state championship; and

Eblen Center, Knoxville Webb defeated Lipscomb Academy 52-47 in their semifinal match-up
and then rolled over CPA 61-47 in the title game to bring home the Gold Ball trophy that
signifies a state champion; and
WHEREAS, the Lady Spartans relied heavily upon the athleticism, leadership, and
determination of Division II-AA state tournament Most Valuable Player and Miss Basketball
finalist Meeyah Green and All-Tournament team honorees Zahnyah Rockett and Kyndall Mays;
and
WHEREAS, this year's title marked Knoxville Webb's seventh state championship in

WHEREAS, the Knoxville girls' basketball team combined with their male counterparts to
demonstrate that two titles are "twice as nice" and celebrated the Spartans 2025 Division II-AA

Lee, Brylee Hooker, Harper Ladd, Zahnyah Rockett, Corisa Lowery, Ivy Napier, Paisley
Headrick, Caroline Macdonald, Brooke Halford, Caroline Copenhaver, Cailyn Taylor, Avery
Green, Meeyah Green, and Kyndall Mays; and
WHEREAS, Knoxville Webb's superb performance would not have been possible
without the stellar leadership of Head Coach Greg Hernandez and assistant coaches Kelley
Cain, Leah Roberts, Charles Wyrick and the unfailing support of the players' families, their fans,
and their community; and
WHEREAS, the members of the Knoxville Webb girls' basketball team epitomize all that
is good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in
competition while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, the perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent of this group of
young women not only made possible a championship season but also surely bode well for their
future success; and

and applaud the Knoxville Webb Lady Spartans for their outstanding season on the hardwood;
