A RESOLUTION to honor the reopening of the historic Loudon
County Courthouse.
WHEREAS, we take great pride in recognizing those venerable public buildings that
stand as beloved historic landmarks in their communities; and

celebrate its unveiling and grand reopening on April 26, 2025, as it returns to public service six
years after a fire ravaged the building on April 23, 2019; and
WHEREAS, the devastating fire took several hours to extinguish and led to over $1
million in damages, resulting in the need for extensive restoration and renovation of the great
building, with some changes made for efficiency, aesthetics, and public safety; and
WHEREAS, the historic Loudon County Courthouse was originally constructed in 1872
by J. Wesley and Ira Napoleon Clarke of Sweetwater for a cost of $14,200, according to the
Loudon County TNGenWeb Project; and
WHEREAS, it has been of the utmost importance to the community and the lovers of
Tennessee's treasured heritage that the courthouse was rebuilt and restored to its former glory,
with the bones of the structure used in its rebuilding; and
WHEREAS, the historic Loudon County Courthouse has served the citizens of Loudon
County with justice and honor for 147 years, and it is fitting that this exemplary public institution
be recognized on this truly special occasion; now, therefore,
