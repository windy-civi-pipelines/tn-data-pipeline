SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 55
By Briggs
A RESOLUTION recognizing National Ovarian Cancer Awareness
Month, September 2025.
WHEREAS, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths of women in the
United States and causes more deaths than any other gynecologic cancer; and
WHEREAS, in the United States, a woman's lifetime risk of being diagnosed with ovarian
cancer is approximately 1 in 78; and
WHEREAS, the American Cancer Society estimates that about 20,890 cases of ovarian
cancer will be newly diagnosed in 2025, and 12,740 women will die from the disease
nationwide, including 380 new cases and 300 deaths in Tennessee; and
WHEREAS, the five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is fifty percent, but survival
rates vary greatly depending on the stage of diagnosis; and
WHEREAS, the five-year survival rate for ovarian cancer is over ninety percent for
individuals diagnosed in early stages; and
WHEREAS, women of color, low-income women, and women living in rural areas have
more barriers to accessing standard quality of care and are more likely to receive care at a
facility that has poorer adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment
guidelines; and
WHEREAS, too many people remain unaware that the symptoms of ovarian cancer
often include bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, urinary
symptoms, and several other vague symptoms that are often easily confused with other
diseases; and

WHEREAS, the lack of an early detection test for ovarian cancer, combined with its
vague symptoms, means that approximately eighty percent of ovarian cancer cases are
detected at an advanced stage; and
WHEREAS, guidelines issued by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and the
Society of Gynecologic Oncology recommend that all individuals diagnosed with ovarian cancer
receive genetic counseling and genetic testing, regardless of their family history; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we join in the recognition of National Ovarian
Cancer Awareness Month, September 2025, to increase public awareness of ovarian cancer.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
