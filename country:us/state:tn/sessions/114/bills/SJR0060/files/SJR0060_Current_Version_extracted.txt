public-spirited citizen of the highest order and as an exceptional asset to his community and his
State; and

as manager of grants tracking and later as the deputy director of contracts review; and
WHEREAS, he joined the staff of the Department of Education in 2002, serving as the
director of contracts and purchasing for three years before moving in 2005 to the Tennessee
