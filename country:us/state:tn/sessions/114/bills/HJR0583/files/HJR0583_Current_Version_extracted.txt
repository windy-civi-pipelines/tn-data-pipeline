HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 583
By Littleton
A RESOLUTION to recognize and commend the St. John Cultural
Arts Center at the Promise Land Historic Site.
WHEREAS, it is our privilege to commemorate a wonderful new cultural center, which
provides a welcoming space that fosters transformative educational and cultural encounters to
all its visitors; and
WHEREAS, the dedication of the St. John Cultural Arts Center at the Promise Land
Historic Site took place on September 8, 2024, at which time this restored church building
officially opened its doors to serve as a permanent home to a variety of cultural activities,
including choral concerts, art exhibitions, and traveling history displays; and
WHEREAS, the St. John Cultural Arts Center is also available for rental throughout the
year for celebrations and meetings; and
WHEREAS, the St. John Cultural Arts Center is housed in the historic St. John
Methodist Church, which was once home to the St. John Methodist congregation; originally
constructed in the 1880s, the building served as a place of worship for members of the
Methodist Episcopal congregation in Promise Land and was the remaining building of three
churches that once served the community settled by formerly enslaved persons and veterans of
the United States Colored Troops of the Union Army; and
WHEREAS, the current structure was built in 1935 to replace the original church
building, which was destroyed by fire; in undertaking the planned restoration of the historic
building, Promise Land Heritage Association (PLHA) contracted with Leatherwood, Inc., which
worked together with the PLHA Restoration Committee and completed the renovation in
December 2023; and

WHEREAS, the building's association with John Lewis and The Promise Land Singers
not only contributes to the site as a destination but, together with the School Museum and the
history of the Promise Land community, also creates an enduring sense of place; and
WHEREAS, it is most appropriate that we specially recognize this welcome addition to
the historically significant Tennessee community of Promise Land; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we recognize the St. John Cultural Arts Center at the Promise Land
Historic Site and commend the Promise Land Heritage Association on its continuing efforts to
share and preserve the rich history of this true Tennessee treasure.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
