A RESOLUTION to designate October 2 as "School Custodian
Day" in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, throughout the school year, the school custodians of Tennessee ensure the
children of the Volunteer State have clean, healthy, and safe learning environments; and

who dedicate countless hours of service to cleaning and maintaining school buildings for our
students and school staff; and

the position, may require custodians to work varying shifts, oftentimes in several locations; they
may be part of a team or work independently, responsible for a multitude of duties; and
WHEREAS, it is most appropriate that we recognize the many contributions of school
custodians to the State of Tennessee; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
