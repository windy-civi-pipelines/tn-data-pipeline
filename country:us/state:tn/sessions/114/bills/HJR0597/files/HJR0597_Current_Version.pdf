HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 597
By Russell
A RESOLUTION to honor Fort Loudoun Electric Cooperative on
the occasion of its eighty-fifth anniversary.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly take great pleasure in recognizing
an organization that has helped bring prosperity and opportunity to the citizens of East
Tennessee for the past eighty-five years; and
WHEREAS, in the 1930s, nine of ten rural farms in Tennessee were without electricity,
and the costs associated with procuring and retaining this life-changing resource were
unbearable for most; and
WHEREAS, concerned citizens living in the rural parts of Blount, Loudon, McMinn,
Meigs, Monroe, and Roane counties came together on August 16 and August 19 of 1940 at the
Madisonville City Hall with a vision to found an electric cooperative in accordance with
legislation passed by the General Assembly in 1935 and 1939; and
WHEREAS, by purchasing some of the electric lines serving Madisonville from the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Tennessee Utilities Company, the Loudon County
Electric Corporation could serve its first members; and
WHEREAS, by the adoption of Articles of Conversion at the Loudon County Courthouse,
the Loudon County Electric Corporation was renamed Fort Loudoun Electric Cooperative
(FLEC) to more accurately represent the region where its potential members lived and worked;
and
WHEREAS, as a private, nonprofit organization owned by its membership, FLEC has
worked with other utilities and the TVA over the years to provide electric service to its members
under a least-cost management philosophy; and

WHEREAS, FLEC is one of the electric cooperatives that deliver power to seventy-two
percent of Tennessee's landmass at rates thirty-seven percent below the national average; and
WHEREAS, FLEC currently serves portions of three counties (Blount, Loudon, and
Monroe) in Tennessee and has grown from serving 364 members with thirty miles of electric
lines in 1941 to serving more than 36,350 members over 3,100 miles of distribution lines today;
and
WHEREAS, growing with the area it serves so tirelessly, FLEC now has a 750 square-
mile service territory that includes a small portion of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
and the Cherokee National Forest in combination with the beauty associated with the shorelines
of portions of the Fort Loudoun and Tellico reservoirs established by TVA to help meet the
energy and economic growth needs of the area; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we recognize and honor Fort Loudoun Electric Cooperative on the
occasion of its eighty-fifth anniversary and thank its board of directors, management, and
employees for their ongoing commitment to providing quality electric service at low rates to its
members in East Tennessee.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
