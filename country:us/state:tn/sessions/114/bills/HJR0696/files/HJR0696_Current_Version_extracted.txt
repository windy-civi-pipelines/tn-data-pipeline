HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 696
By Vital
A RESOLUTION to honor and recognize the fiftieth anniversary of
the Chattanooga Allergy Clinic.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we pay tribute to those exemplary organizations and their
remarkable personnel who work with purpose and conviction to improve the quality of life in their
respective communities; and
WHEREAS, one such estimable institution is the Chattanooga Allergy Clinic (CAC),
which is commemorating its fiftieth anniversary this year, marking five decades of providing the
highest-quality allergy and immunodeficiency care; and
WHEREAS, the Chattanooga Allergy Clinic, founded in 1975 by Dr. Hyman Kaplan, was
the first full-service allergy and immunology clinic in the city, and since then, CAC has met the
needs of a population dealing with the effects of an exceptionally high pollen count; and
WHEREAS, before CAC was established, Chattanooga residents traveled to Nashville
or Atlanta, Georgia, to see an allergy specialist; and
WHEREAS, CAC treats allergies, asthma, immunodeficiency, and food allergies, in
addition to skin and sinus conditions in pediatric and adult patients; the clinic utilizes
compassionate care and seeks to increase the quality of patients' lives, while overall reducing
the need for emergency room visits and hospital admissions; and
WHEREAS, since its inception, the Chattanooga Allergy Clinic has grown from five
employees and one location to more than 130 employees, six double-board-certified physicians,
eleven nurse practitioners, and eight locations in the Greater Chattanooga area and has seen
significant advancements in the testing and treatment of allergic disease and immunologic
deficiencies; and
