SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 41
By Yarbro
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of John Richard "Dick"
Lodge, Jr.
WHEREAS, we were greatly saddened to learn of the passing of John Richard "Dick"
Lodge, Jr., a former public servant in this great State and in Washington, D.C.; and
WHEREAS, Dick Lodge was a distinguished attorney for forty-seven years, a forty-two-
year member of the Lodge Manufacturing Company Board of Directors in South Pittsburg, a
member and officer of the University of the South's Board of Regents, and a consummate
government relations professional and friend to many on Capitol Hill; and
WHEREAS, born in Sewanee on June 16, 1949, Mr. Lodge was the son of Reverend
John Richard Lodge and Sarah Virginia "Pat" Lodge; he moved with his family a great deal in
his youth, from Tennessee to Alabama to Alaska, ultimately graduating from Escambia County
High School in Atmore, Alabama; and
WHEREAS, after graduating from the University of the South at Sewanee in 1971, he
earned his Juris Doctor degree from Vanderbilt University School of Law in 1974, thereafter
joining the legal team of Tennessee Attorney General R.A. Ashley for two years; he later
resigned from that position to join the fledgling, yet ultimately successful, campaign of U.S.
Senator Jim Sasser, who was elected to Congress in 1976; and
WHEREAS, Dick Lodge moved to Washington, D.C., as Senator Sasser's first Director
of Legislation, a fortuitous endeavor in that it was there that he met his future wife, Gina, who
was working for another freshman, Senator Patrick Moynihan of New York; and
WHEREAS, Dick and Gina married in 1978 and returned to Nashville, where Mr. Lodge
joined the law firm of Willis and Knight; during his tenure as a young lawyer in Nashville, he
became well known for his culinary skills involving all manner of cast iron cookware made by his

family's business in South Pittsburg, owing much to his family's background for generations in
the cast iron skillet business along with Gina's hearty encouragement; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Lodge was elected to serve as the statewide Democratic Party Chair in
1983; during his five-year tenure, he headed the committee of Southern States to create Super
Tuesday; at the urging of former Lt. Governor Frank Gorrell, he moved his legal practice to
become a partner at the firm of Bass, Berry & Sims, chairing the Government Relations Practice
area; and
WHEREAS, concurrently with his work at the law firm for thirty-three years, he remained
interested and active in State and local government functions, leading to his appointment by
Mayor Phil Bredesen as the first Chairman of Nashville's new Sports Authority in 1995; his
leadership talents and gifts manifested in his church work and community service, with him
serving as Senior Warden at Christ Church Cathedral, President of Legal Services of Middle
Tennessee, and a legal and business advisor to Thistle Farms; and
WHEREAS, he was dedicated to mentoring young lawyers, young political leaders, and
spiritual leaders destined for prominence in the Episcopal Church; while his forceful strength of
advocacy was to be admired, he offered never-ending quiet kindnesses to those needing help;
and
WHEREAS, above all, Dick Lodge was wholly devoted to his friends and his family,
always endeavoring to remain true and loyal to those he loved; and
WHEREAS, he is survived by his beloved wife of forty-six years, Virginia "Gina" Tyler
Lodge, former Tennessee Commissioner of Human Services for eight years; his children, Sarah
Lodge (Trey) Tally and Richard Matthew (Rachael) Lodge; his grandchildren, Virginia Frances
Tally, Earl Burton "E.B." Tally IV, John Richard "Jack" Lodge II, and Josephine Bright Lodge; his
siblings, David (Andrea) Lodge, Sarah A. Lodge, and Henry (Donna) Lodge; and many
nephews, nieces, great-nephews, and great-nieces; and

WHEREAS, Dick Lodge was a man of courage and honor in his business dealings as
well as in his private life, and his friendship was a blessing to all who had the good fortune of

life and compassion and loyalty in private life, living life with diligence and dedication to all his
chosen endeavors; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should remember and honor the bountiful life of this
exceptional public servant and human being; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
