SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 164
By Oliver
A RESOLUTION to recognize the Rho Psi Chapter of Omega Psi
Phi Fraternity, Inc., on the ninety-fifth
anniversary of its founding.
WHEREAS, this General Assembly takes great pleasure in recognizing those
organizations that promote brotherhood, community service, and societal progress; and
WHEREAS, one such organization is the Rho Psi Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity,
Inc., which celebrates the ninety-fifth anniversary of its founding this year; and
WHEREAS, Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., is an international fraternal organization
founded on November 17, 1911, at Howard University in Washington, D.C.; deeply committed to
academic excellence, community service, and leadership development, the fraternity has been
a driving force in uplifting African-American communities and promoting positive change for over
a century; and
WHEREAS, on April 11, 1930, Rho Psi Chapter #39 was founded at Tennessee A&I
State College, now Tennessee State University (TSU), through the efforts of College President
William J. Hale, Professor James F. McClellan, Robert E. Clay, and Delta, Gamma Phi, and Eta
Psi chapters; Rho Psi was the first chapter of a Greek-letter organization established on the
campus and the only chapter of Omega Psi Phi organized in 1930; and
WHEREAS, the charter members of the Rho Psi Chapter were Ned Rawls, George
Hale, Halton Williams, William Harris, Kurtis Clay, Thomas Withrow, James Taylor, and John
Wallace; and
WHEREAS, only one decade later, during the 1940 conclave, Rho Psi Chapter, deemed
the model chapter of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, stood in the spotlight as it gave to the
national organization its Lampados Song (pledge club song), composed by Hilton Owens, and
SJR0164

- 1 -
its Sweetheart Song, composed by Don Q. Pullen; the national body voted unanimously that
recordings of these two songs be made by Rho Psi Chapter and circulated wherever chapters
and Omega men were located; and
WHEREAS, in 1952-1953, it is rumored that, while doing a military march at a lampados
pledge session, one of the lamps, Charles Dowdy, Jr., did not stop and continued to march, at
the end of which he said, "Omega Omega Omega Psi Phi"; this was adopted by the brothers
(with Joe Stamps, Neophyte Commandant) on campus, and they put words and steps together
and started the first Que Hop in the fraternity; and
WHEREAS, they also developed four principals of hopping—Style, Soul, Grace, and
Expression—and then adopted "the Hop," which has won many national conclave and Greek
shows; the Rho Psi Chapter of Omega Psi Phi was the first Greek organization to hop, and this
is where hopping was started and done with perfection; and
WHEREAS, the Rho Psi Chapter ended the 1961-1962 academic year with 105 financial
brothers, the highest scholarship on campus, forty brothers on the dean's list, seven of fourteen
student council seats held by Omegas, and five brothers commissioned in the U.S. Air Force;
and
WHEREAS, the 25th Grand Basileus Cary D. Jacobs (1961-1964) and the national
executive secretary visited the campus in 1961-1962, and, upon reporting to the national body,
stated this is the "Mighty" Rho Psi Chapter, thus establishing the name "MIGHTY RHO PSI
CHAPTER"; and
WHEREAS, in 2000, "Project Rho Psi 2000" was spearheaded by Larry Brown, 5th
District Director Mark Bishop, and a board of directors that included Walter Vincent, Floyd
Harrison, David Saunders, Joe Emmons, Woodrow Bell, Rick Jones, Alfred Motlow, Willie
Bates, Gene Robinson, and Philmore Graham; and
- 2 - 003534
WHEREAS, Project Rho Psi 2000 helped erect the first Greek monument on TSU's
campus and endowed over $150,000; a second campaign, launched by the Rho Psi Alumni
Chapter in 2016 and called Project Rho Psi Reloaded, raised another $100,000 to expand the
monument and create more opportunity for perpetual giving; and
WHEREAS, the monument expansion was completed in 2019, thanks to the leadership
of the Project Rho Psi Reloaded committee: Harrison Foy, chair; Alvino Douglass, president;
Martez Moore, vice president; Woody Bell; Alfred Gordon; Floyd Harrison; Jeffrey Midcalf; and
Jonathan Railey; and
WHEREAS, the Rho Psi Alumni Chapter, which was established in 2011, was the first
chapter to be recognized with the TBR Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Philanthropy; and
WHEREAS, the Rho Psi Chapter is the only Greek-letter organization on any HBCU or
PWI to erect a perpetual giving monument and giving model; and
WHEREAS, the Rho Psi Chapter has always endeavored to foster brotherly love and
fraternal spirit at Tennessee State University, and the many men who have been initiated into
Rho Psi are a testament to the chapter's success; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we recognize and honor the Rho Psi Chapter of
Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., as its members celebrate the ninety-fifth anniversary of the
