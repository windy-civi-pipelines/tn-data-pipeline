dedicated law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line while carrying out their
essential duties; and

public servant, who gave his life while serving his fellow citizens on December 14, 2024; and

arts, ultimately earning a sixth-degree black belt; his dedication to this endeavor exemplified his
relentless spirit and grit that defined his life; and
