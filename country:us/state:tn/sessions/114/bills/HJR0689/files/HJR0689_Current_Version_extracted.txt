HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 689

A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Pope Francis.

the passing of Pope Francis on Monday, April 21, 2025; and
WHEREAS, born on December 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, as Jorge Mario
Bergoglio, Pope Francis entered the Society of Jesus at age twenty-one and was ordained as a
Jesuit priest in 1969; he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992 by St. John
Paul II, became archbishop of the Argentine capital in 1998, and was created cardinal in 2001;
and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis ascended to the papacy on March 13, 2013, upon the
retirement of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI, becoming the first pontiff from Latin America;
and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis dedicated his entire life to the service of God and His Church
and teaching the values of the Gospel with fidelity, courage, and universal love, especially for
the poorest and most marginalized; and
WHEREAS, during his almost thirteen-year pontificate, Pope Francis focused on mercy,
care for creation, and attention to those on the "peripheries of both the Church and society"; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis canonized 942 saints during his papacy, more than any of his
predecessors, including Saint John Paul II, Paul VI, and John XXIII; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis published four encylicals Dilexit Nos ("He Loved Us") (24

(24 May 2015) and Lumen Fidei ("The Light of Faith") (29 June 2013), seven apostolic
exhortations, and seventy-five motu proprio documents; and

WHEREAS, Pope Francis, who repeatedly called for peace in the Holy Land and in
Ukraine, faced many unprecedented challenges during his papacy, including the global COVID-
19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, in his final Urbi et Orbi remarks, just hours before his death, Pope Francis
reminded the faithful of the dignity of all persons, but most especially the vulnerable, the
marginalized, and migrants, and encouraged all of us "to hope anew and revive our trust in
others, including those who are different from ourselves, or who come from distant lands,
bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas"; and
WHEREAS, Pope Francis led a holy life focused on humility, simplicity, poverty of spirit,
and a radical devotion to Christ's call of charity to the least among us; and
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should remember the abundant life of this human being
and successor to Saint Peter; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of Pope Francis, reflecting fondly upon his immense
holiness and his legacy of service to those most in need.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
