HOUSE BILL 1220
By Johnson
AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 4;
Title 8; Title 53; Title 56; Title 63; Title 68 and Title
71, relative to contraceptives.
WHEREAS, the legislature declares that freedom to access, use, or refuse a
contraceptive method of choice is a fundamental right, central to a person's liberty, privacy,
health, well-being, dignity, equality, and ability to participate in the social and economic life of
this State; and
WHEREAS, the legislature finds that contraception is safe and essential health care, and
access to contraceptive products and services is necessary for the prevention of unintended
pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as for a person's ability to participate
equally in economic and social life, and make decisions about their families and their lives; and
WHEREAS, the legislature finds that the right to make personal decisions about
contraceptive use is important for all people, and is especially critical for historically
marginalized groups, including African-American, indigenous, and other people of color;
immigrants; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people; people with disabilities;
people with low incomes; and people living in rural and underserved areas; and
WHEREAS, the legislature finds that broad access to contraceptives is internationally
recognized by the World Health Organization as advancing other human rights, such as the
right to life, liberty, expression, health, work, and education; and
WHEREAS, the legislature determines that readily and practically available
contraceptive procedures, supplies, and information regardless of sex, race, age, gender,
income, number of children, marital status, citizenship, or motive is in the best interest of the
people of this State; now, therefore,
