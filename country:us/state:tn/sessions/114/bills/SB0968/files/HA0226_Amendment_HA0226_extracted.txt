WHEREAS, this State must continue to build upon its long-standing partnership with the
Tennessee Valley Authority, which has led the nation in effective and efficient generation of
electricity using nuclear, gas, coal, and hydro-electric energy sources; and
WHEREAS, this State must implement a strategic plan for building and maintaining
energy infrastructure that is scalable and robust enough to not only meet our current energy
availability and production but to accommodate our ever-increasing future energy demands; and
WHEREAS, preparing for a nuclear power renaissance and maintaining a competitive
advantage in all things nuclear, including nuclear manufacturing and nuclear energy, will require
this State to maintain and build upon the nuclear energy resources in Oak Ridge and other parts
of East Tennessee while developing traditional and emerging energy technologies; and
WHEREAS, it is vital that policymakers in this State understand the strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats associated with our current energy sources and
capabilities, as well as any future energy development and production; and
WHEREAS, the Tennessee energy policy council was reconstituted in 2024 to include
subject matter experts from all segments of the energy production and delivery markets in order
to ensure policymakers receive the best possible recommendations on all aspects of current
and future energy production capabilities; and

energy policy; and
