owned and used as the disabled veteran's residence as provided in this section.
(2) The reimbursement must be paid on the first one hundred seventy-five
thousand dollars ($175,000) of the full market value of the property, as determined by
the assessor of property in accordance with this chapter.

first one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars ($175,000) of the full market value must
be multiplied by the ad valorem tax rate in that jurisdiction.
