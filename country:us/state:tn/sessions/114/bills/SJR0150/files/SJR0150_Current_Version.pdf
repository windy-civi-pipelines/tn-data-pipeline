SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 150
By McNally
A RESOLUTION to honor members of the 134th Air Refueling
Wing of the Tennessee Air National Guard on
receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross.
WHEREAS, our nation was conceived by individuals who were willing to sacrifice their
personal safety and concerns to ensure our individual and collective freedom, and the Volunteer
State is especially proud to be the home of so many valiant men and women who have
performed above and beyond the call of duty; and
WHEREAS, while the heroic deeds of Tennesseans have been extolled throughout the
history of our State and nation, the distinguished military service of every proud Tennessean
should be illuminated, shared, and properly honored but perhaps none more so than the recent
heroic actions of the members of the 134th Air Refueling Wing of the Tennessee Air National
Guard, who have been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for their actions during an attack
on Israel, April 13-14, 2024; and
WHEREAS, the Distinguished Flying Cross is awarded for heroism or extraordinary
achievement while participating in aerial flight. The heroism or achievement must be entirely
distinctive, involving operations that are not routine; the Distinguished Flying Cross is the
highest award for extraordinary aerial achievement and has only been awarded to KC 135 crew
members twenty-five times in our nation's history; and
WHEREAS, the Airmen of the 134th Air Refueling Wing of the Tennessee Air National
Guard that we honor for their receipt of the Distinguished Flying Cross are Lieutenant Colonel
Willis Parker, Major Cody Gaby, Major Lance Welch, Major Stacy Sells, Captain Joshua
Johnson, Captain James Spearman, First Lieutenant Andrew Weber, Technical Sergeant
Joshua Osborne, Technical Sergeant Gage Seymour, Technical Sergeant Hunter Ricks, and
Senior Airman Jonah Parham; and

WHEREAS, the receipt of the Distinguished Flying Cross by these heroic Airmen is the
result of their actions taken as part of Operation INHERENT RESOLVE, where they were
tasked to perform a combat air refueling mission and found themselves in the direct line of fire
after two regional adversaries launched a coordinated offensive attack on Israel; and
WHEREAS, despite the high-stakes situations, the aircrew maintained their composure
and relayed vital, real-time information updates, enabling other coalition forces to respond
effectively to the attack. While evading airborne threats without the benefit of onboard
defensive systems or situational awareness-enhancing tools common to combat aircraft, the
aircrew adapted to their mission to meet the air refueling needs of numerous combat assets,
enabling and enhancing the defense of the unprecedented attack with increased on-station time
and engagement potential; and
WHEREAS, their exceptional aviation skills allowed the crews to offload tens of
thousands of pounds of fuel during the mission, directly contributing to the successful defense of
allied personnel and assets. The successful defense of the United States ally led directly to
regional de-escalation over the next several days, saving countless lives. The professional
competence, aerial skill, and devotion to duty displayed reflect great credit upon themselves, the
Tennessee Air National Guard, and the United States Air Force; and
WHEREAS, these members of the 134th Air Refueling Wing of the Tennessee Air
National Guard performed their duties with the utmost skill, dedication, and professionalism;
their service can only be categorized as outstanding; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we hereby honor and commend the members of the
134th Air Refueling Wing of the Tennessee Air National Guard on their receipt of the
Distinguished Flying Cross and offer our thanks for a difficult job well done.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
