HOUSE RESOLUTION 130
By Sparks
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Mary Jane Skinner for
her contributions to the State of Tennessee.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those citizens who, through their
extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as community leaders of whom we can all
be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy person is Mary Jane Skinner of La Vergne, a highly
respected member of her community who has dedicated herself to improving the quality of life
for her fellow citizens; and
WHEREAS, in 1956, Mary Jane Skinner and her husband moved from Louisiana to La
Vergne after he received a military transfer to Stewart Air Base; there, they established a home
with their three young children, John, Jammie, and Jerome, in what would later become part of
the City of La Vergne; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Skinner served with distinction for thirty-two years as a cafeteria worker
in the Rutherford County School System, where she nourished and cared for countless children
and contributed to their daily lives; and
WHEREAS, she also worked diligently as head cashier at Zayer's from 1961 until the
store's closure in 1990, exemplifying a strong work ethic and a steadfast commitment to her
responsibilities; and
WHEREAS, beyond her professional contributions, Mary Jane Skinner has given
generously of her time and energy to a number of civic and community organizations, including
the Parent Teacher Organization, the Home Demonstration Club, and the La Vergne Senior

WHEREAS, since 1974, she has been a vital volunteer with the La Vergne Rescue Unit,
Inc., which she has served as an emergency medical technician, selflessly providing aid and
comfort in times of need; and
WHEREAS, Mary Jane Skinner's greatest accomplishments, however, are found within
her family; she has raised her three children, assisted in the upbringing of her four
grandchildren, and is now a proud great-great-grandmother whose nurturing spirit and
commitment to family and community truly embody the essence of service; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Skinner epitomizes the spirit and commitment to family and community
that are characteristic of a true Tennessean; and
WHEREAS, Mary Jane Skinner will celebrate her ninetieth birthday on August 30, 2025,
and she continues to embody the compassion and energy that have defined her long and fruitful
life; and
WHEREAS, it is most appropriate that we recognize this exceptional woman who has
contributed so meaningfully to the life and spirit of La Vergne and whose legacy will continue to
inspire generations to come; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor and
commend Mary Jane Skinner for her devoted service to her community and the State of
Tennessee and extend to her our best wishes for much continued success and happiness in the
years ahead.
