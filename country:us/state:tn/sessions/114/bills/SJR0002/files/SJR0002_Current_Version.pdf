WHEREAS, Israel has long been, and remains, America's most reliable partner in the
Middle East, with both nations bound closely by historic and cultural ties as well as by mutual
interests; and

1948, and the first to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017; and
WHEREAS, the United States participates in a high number of exchanges with Israel, to
include joint military exercises, military research, and weapons development, and through the
Joint Counterterrorism Group and a semiannual Strategic Dialogue, the United States and Israel
have enhanced their cooperation in fighting terrorism; and
WHEREAS, at this time of continued uncertainty in the world, Tennessee again desires
to reaffirm its friendship with the Nation of Israel by expressing its unequivocal support for the
Nation of Israel; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
