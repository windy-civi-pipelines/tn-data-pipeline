HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 310
By Atchley
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Carl Dean.
WHEREAS, it was with great sadness that the members of this General Assembly
learned of the passing of Carl Dean, husband, partner, and biggest supporter of his wife, Dolly
Parton, for sixty years; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Dean was a private man who eschewed the limelight of the music
industry to focus on real estate dealings and attending to the couple's Nashville ranch; and
WHEREAS, although he shied away from the red carpet and show business functions,
Mr. Dean deeply loved and respected Dolly Parton, and his unwavering support was
instrumental in her perseverance in the music industry and her successful career as an artist
and icon; and
WHEREAS, Carl Dean also served as an inspiration for Dolly Parton's songwriting;
according to rumor, "Jolene," one of her signature songs, is partly based on a bank teller who
flirted with her husband; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Dean was also the inspiration behind other songs written by his wife,
including "From Here to the Moon and Back," "Forever Love," "Say Forever You'll Be Mine," and
"Tomorrow is Forever," and he was featured on the cover of her album My Blue Ridge Mountain
Boy; and
WHEREAS, to honor his never-ending love and support of his wife and her career, a
special section has been dedicated to Carl Dean at the Dolly Parton Experience museum at
Dollywood; and

WHEREAS, in 2016, Carl Dean and Dolly Parton renewed their marriage vows in
celebration of their fiftieth wedding anniversary, proving that "if they had it to do all over again,
they'd do it all over again"; and
WHEREAS, the couple first met at a laundromat in 1964 on the very first day Dolly
Parton moved to Nashville to pursue a career in country music; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Dean and Miss Parton began dating, but soon thereafter, he enlisted in
the National Guard and served two years during the Vietnam era; and
WHEREAS, in order to avoid publicity, they were secretly wed in 1966, and it was then
that their magical journey through life together began; and
WHEREAS, a Nashville native, Mr. Dean was the son of the late Edgar "Ed" Henry Dean
and the late Virginia "Ginny" Bates Dean; and
WHEREAS, in addition to his wife, Mr. Dean is survived by siblings, Sandra and Donnie;
and
WHEREAS, upon his passing, Dolly Parton poignantly said: "Carl and I spent so many
wonderful years together. Words cannot do justice to the love we shared for over sixty years";
now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of Carl Dean, reflecting fondly upon the purposeful
life of "a good husband and a good man."
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we express our sympathy and extend our
condolences to Dolly Parton and Mr. Dean's family and friends.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
