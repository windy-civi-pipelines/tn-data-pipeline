Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 34
By Akbari
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Kenneth Whalum III of
Memphis.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those citizens who, through their
extraordinary efforts and artistic contributions, have distinguished themselves as community
leaders of whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such noteworthy person is Kenneth Whalum III of Memphis, a top
session and touring saxophonist who rose quickly in the music industry by working with artists
who are household names, while also carving out a deep and unique niche as a modern solo
artist; and
WHEREAS, Kenneth Whalum III hails from the highly respected Whalum family of
Memphis, the members of which, over four generations, have distinguished themselves time
and again in the fields of music, worship, and public service; and
WHEREAS, Kenneth Whalum's musical genre may be most related to alt-soul, but his
secret to songwriting is being honest and real, as exemplified by his most recent single, Say
Sorry, and his deeply emotional 2021 release, One More Kiss, which taps straight into the heart
of the matter; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Whalum's musical journey began in sixth grade, when he was
encouraged by his band director to play the saxophone because of his familial connection to the
legendary sax player Kirk Whalum; and
WHEREAS, after pursuing higher education at Morehouse College, in 2004, he enrolled
in The New School in New York City, where he honed his musical skills and solidified his
dedication to a career in music; and

WHEREAS, Kenneth Whalum's music is deeply influenced by the legacy of Memphis
music, particularly Gospel and R&B, which have shaped his sound and his understanding of
soul music as an expression of personal truth and honesty; and
WHEREAS, his decision to transition from a successful career as a top-level
saxophonist to pursuing his own music and singing demonstrates his commitment to artistic
liberation and self-expression; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Whalum's collaborations with respected artists such as D’Angelo, the
late Mac Miller, and Justine Skye and his performances at prestigious venues like the
Hollywood Bowl showcase his versatility and passion for his craft; and
WHEREAS, Kenneth Whalum III epitomizes the spirit and commitment to family and
community that are characteristic of a true Tennessean; and
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we acknowledge and applaud Mr. Whalum for his
commitment to excellence in music and beyond; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor and commend
Kenneth Whalum III for his indelible contributions to music and extend to him our best wishes
for much continued success.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.
