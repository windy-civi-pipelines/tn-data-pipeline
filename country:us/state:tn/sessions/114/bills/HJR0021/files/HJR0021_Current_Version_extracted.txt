HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 21
By Clemmons
A RESOLUTION to honor the memory of Mike O'Neil of Nashville.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly were greatly saddened to learn of
the passing of Mike O'Neil, a gentleman who was essential to youth sports in the Nashville area
for twenty-five years as a USA Hockey official; and
WHEREAS, Mr. O'Neil was ubiquitous at every level of hockey in Nashville; he loved
playing and coaching the sport, but it is his work as an on-ice official for which he will be most
remembered; and
WHEREAS, he earned certification as a USA Hockey referee when he moved to the
Music City, his move coinciding with the Nashville Predators' inaugural season in the NHL; and
WHEREAS, Mr. O'Neil officiated numerous recreational and travel league, high school,
and college club hockey games over the years; he eventually became certified as an off-ice
official for the NHL and worked Predators' home games; and
WHEREAS, noted for his disarming smile, he continued to play hockey competitively
and often participated in adult tournaments as a member of an all-O'Neil-family team; and
WHEREAS, when his health began to fail in 2020, Mike O'Neil continued to referee
hockey matches during his medical treatment, and he was fortunate to officiate the game he
loved until near the end of his purposeful and productive life; and
WHEREAS, in recognition of Mr. O'Neil's many enduring contributions both on and off
the ice and his legacy in Nashville's hockey community, the Greater Nashville Area Scholastic
Hockey League's all-star game trophy has been named in his honor; and

WHEREAS, Mike O'Neil gave selflessly of himself in support of hundreds of hockey
players, helping them develop their skills at a crucial age, and his life should be properly
commemorated; now, therefore,

FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor the memory of Mike O'Neil, reflecting fondly upon his impeccable

O'Neil's family and friends.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
