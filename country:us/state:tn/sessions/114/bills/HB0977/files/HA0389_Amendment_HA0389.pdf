apply to those members retiring on or after the effective date of the resolution
adopted by the political subdivision's chief governing body, and who have

benefit must commence on the member's effective date of retirement or on the
first day of the month following the month the member reaches fifty-five (55)
years of age, whichever is later. Members retiring between fifty-five (55) and
sixty (60) years of age shall be paid the supplemental bridge benefit for a period
not to exceed seven (7) years after the member's effective date of retirement.
Members retiring after reaching sixty (60) years of age, but no later than sixty-two
(62) years of age shall be paid the supplemental bridge benefit until the member
reaches sixty-seven (67) years of age. The supplemental bridge benefit and any
cost-of-living adjustments attributable to the benefit must cease on the first day of

may adopt, through a resolution passed by the political subdivision's chief
governing body, the supplemental bridge benefit under subdivision (i)(1). The
political subdivision's change to the supplemental bridge benefit under
subdivision (i)(1) will be irrevocable, and the political subdivision shall not be
permitted to elect the previously adopted supplemental bridge benefit at a later
date.

retirement allowance for purposes of chapter 36, part 8 of this title.

under subsection (a), or upon the effective date of the mandatory retirement age
provision for service covered under subsection (b). Subdivision (f)(2) becomes effective
on July 1, 2007, for service covered under subsection (a), or upon the effective date of

subsection (b), which includes the supplement bridge benefit, or the effective date of the
