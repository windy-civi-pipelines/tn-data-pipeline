Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 53
By Massey
A RESOLUTION to designate May 2025 as "Osteoporosis
Awareness and Prevention Month."
WHEREAS, an estimated 54 million Americans have osteoporosis or low bone mass,
and studies suggest that approximately one in two women and up to one in four men age fifty
and older will break a bone due to osteoporosis; and
WHEREAS, approximately 1.8 million Medicare beneficiaries suffered approximately 2.1
million osteoporotic fractures a year, and osteoporosis-related bone fractures are responsible
for more hospitalizations than heart attacks, strokes, or breast cancer; and
WHEREAS, the total annual cost for osteoporotic fractures among Medicare
beneficiaries was $57 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow to over $95 billion in 2040 without
reforms, as the population ages; and
WHEREAS, in Tennessee, over 123,000 Medicare beneficiaries suffered over 147,700
osteoporotic fractures in 2016; and
WHEREAS, an estimated 6,000 Tennesseans on Medicare suffered not just an initial
fracture but also a subsequent fracture, resulting in estimated costs of over $114 million; and
WHEREAS, osteoporosis and the broken bones it can cause are not part of normal
aging. Building strong bones begins in childhood and is essential to the prevention of
osteoporosis; care for our bones is important throughout our lives, but we reach our peak bone
mass by early adulthood; and
WHEREAS, optimum bone health and prevention of osteoporosis can be maximized by
a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing and muscle-strengthening
exercise, and a healthy lifestyle with no smoking or excessive alcohol intake; and
SR0053

WHEREAS, osteoporosis is often called a silent disease because one cannot feel bones
weakening. Breaking a bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis; timely bone health
screening, diagnosis, and treatment can help prevent fractures leading to hospitalization and
nursing home stays; and
WHEREAS, cost effective post-fracture care that improves care coordination has been
demonstrated to reduce the number of subsequent or repeat fractures, yet the care is not widely
available or properly incentivized by Medicare; and
WHEREAS, it is crucial that we raise awareness about bone health and osteoporosis
among the public, health professionals, and policy makers; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we designate May 2025 as
"Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month."
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy.
