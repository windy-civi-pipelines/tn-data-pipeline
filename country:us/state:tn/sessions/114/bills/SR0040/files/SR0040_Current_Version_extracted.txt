WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should salute those citizens who, through their
extraordinary efforts and artistic contributions, have distinguished themselves as community

WHEREAS, one such noteworthy person is Kirk Whalum of Memphis, an R&B and
smooth jazz saxophonist and songwriter who has earned commercial success and critical
acclaim during his four-decade career; and
WHEREAS, Kirk Whalum hails from the highly respected Whalum family of Memphis,
the members of which, over four generations, have distinguished themselves time and again in
the fields of music, worship, and public service; and

BWB, along with trumpeter Rick Braun and guitarist Norman Brown; he has worked and
collaborated with such artists as Quincy Jones, Babyface, Michael McDonald, and Luther
Vandross, to name but a few; and
WHEREAS, among his standout contributions are touring with Whitney Houston for
more than seven years and soloing on her single "I Will Always Love You," the best-selling
single by a female artist in music history, as well as winning his first Grammy in 2011 for Best
Gospel Song with "It's What I Do," featuring Lalah Hathaway; and
