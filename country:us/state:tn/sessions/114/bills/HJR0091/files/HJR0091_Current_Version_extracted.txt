Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 91
By White
A RESOLUTION expressing support for the Crisis Recovery
Network coordinated by the Southern Regional
Education Board and the participation of the
State of Tennessee, recognizing the Network as
a trusted support for Tennessee schools,
districts, and postsecondary institutions to call
upon if the need arises.
WHEREAS, after natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods and after
school shootings and in public emergencies, recovery must be prioritized as a long-term
process, rather than an immediate response only; and
WHEREAS, states, districts, and postsecondary institutions have focused on crisis
prevention and management, but may not have the capacity to provide sustained support for
their students, teachers, communities, and even their own counselors during the recovery stage;
and
WHEREAS, rural districts and institutions in particular tend to have fewer counselors and
limited access to additional counseling resources; and
WHEREAS, school counselors are often expected to respond to student needs after
tragedy, even as they themselves grapple with the emotional toll, underscoring the need for
external support for the entire school community; and
WHEREAS, schools and institutions affected by crisis may require at least a year of
dedicated support to fully recover; and
WHEREAS, recovery efforts can strain resources that are already stretched thin, given
that a National Center for Education Statistics study showed that less than half of public schools
surveyed believe that their school is able to provide mental health services to all students in
need; and

WHEREAS, recovery is an extended healing process for students and adults alike, and
having additional counselors come to the aid of a school or institution in extreme need supports
the healing process of all people in the community, including teachers and counselors at that
school; and
WHEREAS, specialized training for counselors is essential to ensure that they have
psychological first aid training and provide counseling that aligns with the unique needs of an
educational environment; and
WHEREAS, research shows that students who receive adequate support after a crisis
are more likely to succeed academically, remain in school, and contribute positively to society;
and
WHEREAS, the Southern Regional Education Board, with its seventy-five-year history of
partnering with states to improve education, is uniquely equipped to lead this effort because of
its ability to mobilize key education and policymaking stakeholders at all levels; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that to meet the urgent need for a coordinated, region-wide effort to provide
consistent long-term counseling capacity that is ready to deploy immediately after a crisis is
managed, we support the SREB Crisis Recovery Support Network.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we recognize that the Southern Regional Education
Board, in close collaboration with governors' offices, state education agencies, local districts,
and postsecondary institutions, will complement existing school and district crisis management
efforts by focusing on long-term healing and psychological resilience and by deploying
counselors with specialized training to schools in extreme need.
