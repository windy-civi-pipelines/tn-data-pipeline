community service, contributing $2.6 billion to Tennessee's economy; and
WHEREAS, these volunteers are the backbone of our communities, and by donating
their time and talents to fulfill needs that would otherwise go unmet, they embody the spirit of
giving; and
WHEREAS, Teresa Cochran of Roane County is one such exemplary person, who is a
recipient of the Governor's Volunteer Stars Award in recognition of her laudable commitment to
her community; and
WHEREAS, a volunteer with the Roane County Anti-Drug Coalition (RCADC) for more
than three years, Teresa Cochran and her service dog, Waylon, have dedicated countless hours
and driven miles to help the Coalition's mission, visiting over eleven schools across the county
on a monthly, sometimes even weekly, basis; and
WHEREAS, for the past two years, Ms. Cochran and Waylon joined RCADC and
Juvenile Probation during summer-long reformative camps for high-risk youth; Waylon was
always the highlight of the day for staff and students; and
