SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 186
By Oliver
A RESOLUTION to honor Shugga Hi Bakery and Café for serving
delicious and nourishing food to the Nashville
community.
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly are pleased to recognize an
outstanding restaurant that has earned loyal customers and received critical accolades for its
far-ranging menu and delectable dishes; and
WHEREAS, Shugga Hi Bakery and Café was founded in 2017 by sisters Sandra Austin,
a banker, and Kathy Leslie, an attorney, neither of whom had any restaurant experience; and
WHEREAS, native Nashvillians, the late Sandra Austin (Shugga San) and Kathy Leslie
(Shugga Kat) were inspired to start their own restaurant by their mother, Catherine, and the fine
example she set; and
WHEREAS, every night, Catherine prepared dinner, including dessert, for her family
after completing her full-time shift as a nurse; as a special treat, she sometimes allowed her
children to sample the dessert before the meal; and
WHEREAS, when the family gathered together around the dinner table to eat, talk, and
enjoy each other's company, Sandra and Kathy experienced a feeling of love that they wanted
to share with their community, and thus, Shugga Hi was born many years later; and
WHEREAS, from its humble origins as a small bakery that was the province of master
baker, Sandra Austin, Shugga Hi has grown leaps and bounds to become a major player in the
revitalization of the Dickerson Pike corridor; and
WHEREAS, its Jazz and Eggs Sunday brunch buffet truly put Shugga Hi on the map,
transforming the café into a lively, post-church destination; and

WHEREAS, Shugga Hi proudly served as a sponsor and caterer for the NFL draft held in
Nashville in April 2019; and
WHEREAS, Shugga Hi survived the COVID pandemic and was beginning to strengthen
its brand when tragedy struck in September 2021 with the passing of Sandra Austin; her sister,
Kathy Leslie, was heartbroken but determined to carry on their joint legacy at Shugga Hi; and
WHEREAS, a mere two months later, Shugga Hi hosted its fifth annual Community
Harvest Meal to honor the life of co-founder Sandra Austin; and
WHEREAS, on November 18, 2021, Ms. Leslie joined with her staff, local elected
officials, and volunteers to distribute 800 free meals to members of the community who were in
need; and
WHEREAS, today, Shugga Hi Bakery and Café features an extensive menu, but the
restaurant's crowning glory and fan favorite is its chicken and waffles dish, which includes
"mouthwatering, juicy, crisp chicken on top of a fluffy, moist, melanated golden cake waffle with
a side of Henny syrup"; and
WHEREAS, Shugga Hi's selection is truly outstanding, as is the management's
commitment to friendly customer service; every customer becomes a member of the Shugga Hi
family and is welcome to sit at Momma's table; and
WHEREAS, an icon in Nashville since 2017, Shugga Hi is deserving of our recognition
as a bastion of good food and even better company; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor Shugga Hi Bakery and Café for serving
delicious and nourishing food to the Nashville community, thank Kathy Leslie and her
employees for extending a warm welcome to people from all walks of life, and wish them all the
best in their future endeavors.
