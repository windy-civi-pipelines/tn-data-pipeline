By Lamar
A RESOLUTION to honor the members and leaders of the
Tennessee Cluster and the South Eastern
Region of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.
WHEREAS, we are pleased to recognize those estimable organizations that, through
their unflagging commitment and unwavering dedication to the highest tenets of community
service, enrich the lives of the citizens of this State; and
WHEREAS, founded at Howard University in 1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA) is the
oldest Greek-letter organization founded by college-educated African-American women; this
international service organization of more than 325,000 initiated members has been a trailblazer
in empowering women, fostering sisterhood, and making impactful contributions to communities
around the globe; and
WHEREAS, the South Eastern Region of Alpha Kappa Alpha includes the states of
Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama, with more than 118 undergraduate and graduate
chapters and over 14,000 active members who are dedicated to the mission of their illustrious
organization; and
WHEREAS, the story of the South Eastern Region began when the Pi Chapter was
chartered at Meharry Medical College in Nashville on April 6, 1921, making it the oldest
undergraduate chapter in the region; the chapter transferred to Fisk University in 1927; and
WHEREAS, initially a member of the Southern Region, which included all chapters in the
southeast, the Pi Chapter was made part of the South Eastern Region in 1932, with the member
states at that time being Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas,
Georgia, and Florida; and

WHEREAS, with continued growth, the South Eastern Region was realigned to its
current three-state configuration in 1962; the Tennessee Cluster of the region continued to grow
as well, and its current membership totals thirty-three chapters across the Volunteer State's
three Grand Divisions; and
WHEREAS, the South Eastern Region is currently led by Director Tracey Morant
Adams, Ph.D., who has ably steered the region toward continued, unparalleled success, ever
furthering the mission of Alpha Kappa Alpha along with her sorors from Tennessee, Mississippi,
and Alabama; and
WHEREAS, it is most fitting that we recognize the exceptional women of Alpha Kappa
Alpha's South Eastern Region and Tennessee Cluster; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we recognize the members and
leaders of the Tennessee Cluster and the South Eastern Region of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority,
Inc., extending our best wishes for their continued success.
