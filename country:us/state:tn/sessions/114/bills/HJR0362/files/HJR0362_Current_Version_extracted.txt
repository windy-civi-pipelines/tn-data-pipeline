Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 362
By Mitchell
A RESOLUTION to recognize and honor Jeff Zentner, author of In
the Wild Light.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that the members of this General Assembly recognize those
accomplished Tennesseans who have devoted their lives to creative endeavors, thereby
enriching the lives of their fellow citizens; and
WHEREAS, one such estimable individual is Jeff Zentner of Nashville, an author of
young adult fiction whose career is a testament to the possibilities that lie at the confluence of
talent, hard work, integrity, and devotion; and
WHEREAS, a standout among Mr. Zentner's novels is In the Wild Light, which is set in
East Tennessee and chronicles the life of Cash Pruitt, a young man being raised by his Papaw
and Mamaw after losing his mother to an opioid addiction; and
WHEREAS, Cash dodges drug dealers and watches out for his best friend, Delaney, as
he spends the summer mowing lawns while she works at the Dairy Queen; when Delaney
secures full scholarships for both of them to an elite prep school in Connecticut, Cash must
grapple with his need to protect and love Delaney and his love for the grandparents who saved
him and the town he would have to leave behind; and
WHEREAS, selected as a New York Times Notable Book, In the Wild Light is an
examination of grief, found family, overcoming adversity, and becoming more than you ever
thought you could be; Jeff Zentner's characters, setting, and compelling prose expertly convey
the trials, loves, and aspirations of a young man from the mountains; and
WHEREAS, books such as In the Wild Light that show the complex truth of East
Tennessee and its people are a balm and a bolster to those from the region and a needed
diplomat to the rest of the world; and

William C. Morris Award, the Amelia Elizabeth Walden Award twice, the Muriel Becker Award,
and the International Literacy Association Award, and he has been longlisted for the Crook's
Corner Book Prize and twice for the Carnegie Medal; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Zentner is a two-time Southern Book Prize finalist and was a finalist for
the Indies Choice Award; he was selected as a Publishers Weekly Flying Start and an Indies
Introduce pick. His books, which have received twenty-one starred reviews, have been
translated into fifteen languages and have been featured on The Today Show, Good Morning
America, and in Vanity Fair and People Magazine; and
WHEREAS, before becoming a writer, he was a musician who recorded with Iggy Pop,
Nick Cave, and Debbie Harry; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Zentner has done much to contribute to the literacy, entertainment, and
well-being of readers the world over, and it is fitting that he be honored; now, therefore,
