SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 519
By Southerland
A RESOLUTION to commend and congratulate Ava Kelly of
Walters State Community College.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that we should pay tribute to those students who, through their
natural talents and unflagging commitment to academic excellence, have distinguished
themselves at the collegiate level; and
WHEREAS, one such exceptional individual is Ava Kelly of Walters State Community
College, who was recently honored for her writing that appeared in Tennessee Mosaic; and
WHEREAS, Tennessee Mosaic is a statewide anthology published annually by Phi
Theta Kappa, the international honor society for community college students; the anthology
featured Ms. Kelly's poetry, which was ultimately awarded first-place honors in its genre; and
WHEREAS, hailing from Newport, Ava Kelly is currently majoring in hospitality business
at Walters State; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Kelly has distinguished herself as one of Tennessee's standout up-and-
coming writers; her recent literary achievement is a tremendous source of pride for her family,
her school, and her community; and
WHEREAS, Ava Kelly's dedication to excellence is clearly deserving of our respect,
admiration, and commendation; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we commend and congratulate Ava Kelly on her
recent honor in the poetry category for her publication in Tennessee Mosaic, extending our best
