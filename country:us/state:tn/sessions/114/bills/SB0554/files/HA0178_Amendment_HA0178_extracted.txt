WHEREAS, this State recognizes the vital role of physicians in ensuring the health and
well-being of its citizens; and
WHEREAS, access to quality medical care is essential for the prosperity and vitality of
our communities; and
WHEREAS, this State, like many other states, is facing a growing shortage of
physicians, particularly in rural and underserved areas; and
WHEREAS, this shortage threatens to undermine the State's healthcare system and
jeopardize the health of Tennesseans; and
WHEREAS, this looming crisis is driven by a complex interplay of factors, including an
aging physician workforce, increasing population demands, and a decline in the number of
physicians entering primary care and other critical specialties; and
WHEREAS, physician burnout, exacerbated by administrative burdens, regulatory
complexities, and increasing demands on their time, is contributing to early retirement and
career changes; and
WHEREAS, the moral injury experienced by physicians, stemming from their inability to
provide optimal care due to systemic constraints and resource limitations, further compounds
the problem; and
WHEREAS, this State acknowledges the urgent need to address this physician shortage
and ensure access to quality health care for all Tennesseans; now, therefore,
