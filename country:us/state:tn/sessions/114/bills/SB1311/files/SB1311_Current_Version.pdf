(1) When determining whether to grant a temporary academic permit
pursuant to subdivision (b)(1) to allow an individual to teach a course for which
an end-of-course examination is required, the commissioner shall consider:
(A) The availability of other faculty or staff who are qualified to

the LEA or public charter school, such as whether the vacancy occurs
during the school year or between school years; and

behalf of the state board, an emergency teaching credential to teach a special education

- 3 - 001105

having adequately met the same requirements that candidates of the EPP in

to the state board. The state board shall set the time frame within which a
director of schools or a director of a public charter school must report the

temporary clinical permit, and who is employed by the director's LEA or public
charter school, who has been suspended or dismissed, or who has resigned
following allegations of misconduct, including sexual misconduct, which, if
substantiated, would warrant consideration for disciplinary action under state
board rules. As used in this subdivision (i)(2), "sexual misconduct" has the same
meaning as defined in § 49-5-417(c)(5).
(j)
(1) Notwithstanding another law to the contrary, and except as provided
