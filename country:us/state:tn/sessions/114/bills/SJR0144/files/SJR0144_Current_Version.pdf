Center for his dedication in helping students establish financial security and stability; and

created a $6,000 "Financial Freedom" scholarship challenge that incentivizes students to
familiarize themselves with the various methods of securing financial independence and facility;
and

personally fundraised the rest of the necessary investment, and he continues to mentor the
three winning students as they journey further into their pecuniary lessons and invest their
scholarship money in a Roth IRA; and

futures, Mr. Jones is fundraising a significantly larger amount to fund the scholarship in
perpetuity, securing this avenue of self-improvement and financial literacy for generations to
come; and
