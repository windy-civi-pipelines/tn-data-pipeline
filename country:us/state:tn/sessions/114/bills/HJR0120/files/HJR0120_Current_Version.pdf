HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 120
By Powers
A RESOLUTION relative to a voluntary reporting system for
Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease in Tennessee.
WHEREAS, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) is one of the most common inherited
neurological disorders, affecting an estimated one in 2,500 people in the United States; this
statistic suggests that approximately 2,800 Tennesseans may be affected by CMT; and
WHEREAS, the Department of Health currently maintains voluntary reporting systems
for various health conditions through its existing web-based information technology system; and
WHEREAS, thus, no additional state appropriation would be required to implement CMT
reporting through existing departmental resources and systems; and
WHEREAS, accurate enumeration of CMT patients would enhance Tennessee's
competitiveness for federal research grants and specialized care centers; and
WHEREAS, this General Assembly recognizes that improved data collection for rare
diseases aligns with the State's commitment to efficient healthcare resource allocation; and
WHEREAS, voluntary reporting through existing healthcare networks would impose no
mandatory costs on healthcare providers or the State; and
WHEREAS, this data collection effort would support Tennessee's healthcare providers in
delivering more targeted and effective care to CMT patients; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that this General Assembly encourages the Department of Health to:
(a) Implement voluntary reporting of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT) cases
through existing electronic health record systems;

(b) Utilize current departmental resources and infrastructure for such data
collection; and
(c) Provide an annual report to the House of Representatives committee having
jurisdiction over subject matters concerning health and the Senate Health and Welfare
Committee on the progress of this voluntary initiative.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it is the intent of this General Assembly that such
voluntary reporting system shall not create any new financial obligations for the State of
Tennessee.
