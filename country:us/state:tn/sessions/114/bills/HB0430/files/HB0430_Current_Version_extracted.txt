of a motion or affidavit stating that there has been no material change in relevant
circumstances since entry of the order and stating the reason for the requested
extension.
(6) The court may extend an extreme risk protection order for a period
that it deems appropriate, up to twelve (12) months.

under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366, held by the respondent.
(b) The law enforcement officer serving an extreme risk protection order issued
pursuant to § 39-17-1367, including a temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order,
- 16 - 002129

owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or possession and any
handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366, held by the
respondent. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms and
ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession and any handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366,
held by the respondent, which are surrendered. Alternatively, if personal service by a
law enforcement officer is not possible or is not required because the respondent was
present at the extreme risk protection order hearing, then the respondent must surrender
all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody,
control, or possession and any handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-
17-1366, held by the respondent, in a safe manner to the control of the local law
enforcement agency immediately after being served with the order by service or
immediately after the hearing at which the respondent was present. A law enforcement
officer may seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to conduct a
search for firearms or ammunition owned or held by the respondent if the officer has
probable cause to believe that there are firearms or ammunition in the respondent's
custody, control, or possession that have not been surrendered.
(c) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of all
firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control,
or possession, or any handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366,
held by the respondent shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms and the quantity and
type of ammunition that have been surrendered, and any permit surrendered, and shall
provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within seventy-two (72) hours after
service of the order, the law enforcement officer serving the order shall file the original
- 17 - 002129
receipt with the court and shall ensure that the officer's law enforcement agency retains
a copy of the receipt.
(d) Upon the sworn statement or testimony of any person alleging that the
respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms or ammunition as
required by an order issued pursuant to § 39-17-1367, the court shall determine whether
probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms
or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession. If the court finds that probable cause exists, then the court must issue a
warrant describing the firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent
and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms or ammunition owned or
possessed by the respondent are reasonably believed to be found and the seizure of all
firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent discovered pursuant to
the search.
(e) If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms or
ammunition surrendered pursuant to this section and the person is determined by the
law enforcement agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or ammunition, then the
firearm or ammunition must be returned to the person, if:
(1) The lawful owner agrees to store the firearm or ammunition in a
manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the
firearm or ammunition; and
(2) The firearm or ammunition is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by
the owner.
(f) Upon the issuance of an extreme risk protection order, the court shall order a
new hearing date and require the respondent to appear no later than three (3) business
days after the issuance of the order. At the hearing, the court shall require proof that the
- 18 - 002129
respondent has surrendered any firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent or in
the respondent's custody, control, or possession. The court may cancel the hearing
upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in compliance with the order.
(g) All law enforcement agencies shall develop policies and procedures
regarding the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, ammunition, or licenses
required to be surrendered under this section.
39-17-1369.
(a) If an extreme risk protection order issued pursuant to § 39-17-1367 is
vacated or ends without extension, then a law enforcement agency holding a firearm or
any ammunition owned by the respondent or any handgun carry permit issued under §
39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366, held by the respondent, that has been surrendered or
seized pursuant to an extreme risk protection order must return the surrendered firearm,
ammunition, or permit, as requested by a respondent only after confirming through a
background check that the respondent is currently eligible to own or possess firearms
and ammunition under federal and state law and after confirming with the court that the
extreme risk protection order has been vacated or has ended without extension.
(b) If an extreme risk protection order is vacated or ends without extension, then
the department of safety, if the department has suspended a handgun carry permit
issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366 pursuant to the entry of an extreme risk
protection order under § 39-17-1367, must reinstate the permit only after confirming that

firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent that have been surrendered to or
seized by a local law enforcement agency pursuant to the extreme risk protection order
to another person who is willing to receive the respondent's firearms and ammunition.
The law enforcement agency shall allow such a transfer only if it is determined that the
chosen recipient:
(1) Currently is eligible to own or possess a firearm and ammunition
under federal and state law after confirmation through a background check;
(2) Attests to storing the firearms and ammunition in a manner such that
the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearms and

respondent until the extreme risk protection order against the respondent is
vacated or ends without extension.

pursuant to § 39-17-1367, including a temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order,
- 16 - 002129

shall request that the respondent immediately surrender all firearms and ammunition
owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or possession and any
handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366, held by the
respondent. The law enforcement officer shall take possession of all firearms and
ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession and any handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366,
held by the respondent, which are surrendered. Alternatively, if personal service by a
law enforcement officer is not possible or is not required because the respondent was
present at the extreme risk protection order hearing, then the respondent must surrender
all firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody,
control, or possession and any handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-
17-1366, held by the respondent, in a safe manner to the control of the local law
enforcement agency immediately after being served with the order by service or
immediately after the hearing at which the respondent was present. A law enforcement
officer may seek a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction to conduct a
search for firearms or ammunition owned or held by the respondent if the officer has
probable cause to believe that there are firearms or ammunition in the respondent's
custody, control, or possession that have not been surrendered.
(c) At the time of surrender, a law enforcement officer taking possession of all
firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control,
or possession, or any handgun carry permit issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366,
held by the respondent shall issue a receipt identifying all firearms and the quantity and
type of ammunition that have been surrendered, and any permit surrendered, and shall
provide a copy of the receipt to the respondent. Within seventy-two (72) hours after
service of the order, the law enforcement officer serving the order shall file the original
- 17 - 002129

receipt with the court and shall ensure that the officer's law enforcement agency retains
a copy of the receipt.
(d) Upon the sworn statement or testimony of any person alleging that the
respondent has failed to comply with the surrender of firearms or ammunition as
required by an order issued pursuant to § 39-17-1367, the court shall determine whether
probable cause exists to believe that the respondent has failed to surrender all firearms
or ammunition owned by the respondent or in the respondent's custody, control, or
possession. If the court finds that probable cause exists, then the court must issue a
warrant describing the firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent
and authorizing a search of the locations where the firearms or ammunition owned or
possessed by the respondent are reasonably believed to be found and the seizure of all
firearms or ammunition owned or possessed by the respondent discovered pursuant to
the search.
(e) If a person other than the respondent claims title to any firearms or
ammunition surrendered pursuant to this section and the person is determined by the
law enforcement agency to be the lawful owner of the firearm or ammunition, then the
firearm or ammunition must be returned to the person, if:
(1) The lawful owner agrees to store the firearm or ammunition in a
manner such that the respondent does not have access to or control of the
firearm or ammunition; and
(2) The firearm or ammunition is not otherwise unlawfully possessed by
the owner.
(f) Upon the issuance of an extreme risk protection order, the court shall order a
new hearing date and require the respondent to appear no later than three (3) business
days after the issuance of the order. At the hearing, the court shall require proof that the
- 18 - 002129

respondent has surrendered any firearms or ammunition owned by the respondent or in
the respondent's custody, control, or possession. The court may cancel the hearing
upon a satisfactory showing that the respondent is in compliance with the order.
(g) All law enforcement agencies shall develop policies and procedures
regarding the acceptance, storage, and return of firearms, ammunition, or licenses
required to be surrendered under this section.
39-17-1369.
(a) If an extreme risk protection order issued pursuant to § 39-17-1367 is
vacated or ends without extension, then a law enforcement agency holding a firearm or
any ammunition owned by the respondent or any handgun carry permit issued under §
39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366, held by the respondent, that has been surrendered or
seized pursuant to an extreme risk protection order must return the surrendered firearm,
ammunition, or permit, as requested by a respondent only after confirming through a
background check that the respondent is currently eligible to own or possess firearms
and ammunition under federal and state law and after confirming with the court that the
extreme risk protection order has been vacated or has ended without extension.
(b) If an extreme risk protection order is vacated or ends without extension, then
the department of safety, if the department has suspended a handgun carry permit
issued under § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366 pursuant to the entry of an extreme risk
protection order under § 39-17-1367, must reinstate the permit only after confirming that
the respondent is currently eligible to have a handgun carry permit issued under § 39-
17-1351 or § 39-17-1366.
(c) A law enforcement agency must provide notice to any family or household
members of the respondent before returning any surrendered firearm and ammunition
owned by the respondent.
- 19 - 002129

(d) Any firearm and ammunition surrendered by a respondent pursuant to § 39-
17-1368 that remains unclaimed by the lawful owner for one (1) year after an order
vacating the extreme risk protection order must be disposed of pursuant to § 39-17-
1317.
39-17-1370.
A respondent in an action pursuant to § 39-17-1367 may elect to transfer all
firearms and ammunition owned by the respondent that have been surrendered to or
seized by a local law enforcement agency pursuant to the extreme risk protection order
to another person who is willing to receive the respondent's firearms and ammunition.
The law enforcement agency shall allow such a transfer only if it is determined that the
chosen recipient:
(1) Currently is eligible to own or possess a firearm and ammunition
under federal and state law after confirmation through a background check;
(2) Attests to storing the firearms and ammunition in a manner such that
the respondent does not have access to or control of the firearms and
ammunition until the extreme risk protection order against the respondent is
vacated or ends without extension; and
(3) Attests not to transfer the firearms or ammunition back to the
respondent until the extreme risk protection order against the respondent is
vacated or ends without extension.
39-17-1371.
(a) Within twenty-four (24) hours after issuance of an order pursuant to § 39-17-
1367, the clerk of the court shall enter any extreme risk protection order or temporary ex
parte extreme risk protection order into the uniform case reporting system.
- 20 - 002129

(b) Within twenty-four (24) hours after issuance, the clerk of the court shall
forward a copy of an order issued pursuant to § 39-17-1367 to the appropriate law
enforcement agency specified in the order. Upon receipt of the copy of the order, the
law enforcement agency shall enter the order into the national crime information center
and similar state databases. The order must remain in each system for the period stated
in the order, and the law enforcement agency may only remove an order from the
systems which has ended or has been vacated. Entry of the order into the national
crime information center and similar state databases constitutes notice to all law
enforcement agencies of the existence of the order. The order is fully enforceable in any
county in this state.
(c) The issuing court shall, within three (3) business days after issuance of an
extreme risk protection order or temporary ex parte extreme risk protection order,
forward all available identifying information concerning the respondent, along with the
date of order issuance, to the department of safety. Upon receipt of the information, the
department shall determine if the respondent has a handgun carry permit issued
pursuant to § 39-17-1351 or § 39-17-1366. If the respondent does have a handgun
carry permit, then the department must immediately suspend the permit.
(d) If an extreme risk protection order is vacated before its end date, the clerk of
the court shall, on the day of the order to vacate, forward a copy of the order to the
department of safety and the appropriate law enforcement agency specified in the order
to vacate. Upon receipt of the order, the law enforcement agency shall promptly remove
the order from any computer-based system in which it was entered pursuant to
subsection (b).
39-17-1372.
- 21 - 002129

(a) A person who makes a false statement under oath in a hearing held pursuant
to § 39-17-1367 in regard to any material matter commits perjury under § 39-16-702.
(b) A person who has in the person's custody or control a firearm or any
ammunition or who purchases, possesses, or receives a firearm or any ammunition with
knowledge that the person is prohibited from doing so by an order issued pursuant to §
39-17-1367 commits a Class E felony.
39-17-1373.
The surrender of a firearm or ammunition pursuant to § 39-17-1368 does not
affect the ability of a law enforcement officer to remove a firearm or ammunition or
handgun carry permit from any person or to conduct any search and seizure for firearms
or ammunition pursuant to other lawful authority.
39-17-1374.
Except as provided in § 39-17-1372, there is no criminal or civil liability on any
person or entity for acts or omissions related to obtaining an extreme risk protection
