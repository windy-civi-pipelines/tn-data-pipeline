HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 33
By Garrett
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend Riley Gaines of Sumner
County.
WHEREAS, it is appropriate that we honor Riley Gaines, a champion swimmer from
Sumner County and a former member of the University of Kentucky Women's swim
team, for her achievements in women's swimming and commend her for the
courageous exercise of her First Amendment right to speak openly regarding women in
sports; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Gaines attended Station Camp High School in Gallatin, and as a
junior, she won the 100-meter butterfly and 100-meter freestyle in the TISCA High
School Swim and Dive Championship in Knoxville in 2017; and
WHEREAS, she joined the University of Kentucky's swim team and made the All-
SEC Freshman Team in 2019 and the All-SEC Second Team in 2019 and 2020. She
participated in the 2021 NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships, coming
in second in the 4 x 200m-freestyle relay and seventh in the 200m-freestyle race, and
earned All-SEC First Team honors that same year; and
WHEREAS, in 2022, Ms. Gaines placed fifth while swimming for the University of
Kentucky in the 200-yard NCAA freestyle championship, tying with University of
Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, who was the first openly transgender woman
champion in the NCAA to compete in the women's division; and
WHEREAS, Riley Gaines campaigns against the inclusion of men in the women's
division of sports, including lobbying her state representatives to pass a law that would

prohibit transgender individuals from women's sports. As part of her campaign, she
participated in protesting the January 2023 NCAA Convention to encourage the NCAA
to enact rules protecting women's sports, and at risk to her personal safety, she has
spoken at political and other public events in support of keeping women's sports for
women; and
WHEREAS, Ms. Gaines made a national and global impact by taking a
courageous stand by publicly speaking about her beliefs that only women should be
competing in women's sports; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we honor and commend Riley Gaines of Sumner County, a true winner, for
