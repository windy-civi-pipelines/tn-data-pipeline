HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 300
By Vital
A RESOLUTION to recognize Keep Tennessee Beautiful and
commemorate the twenty-sixth annual Great
American Cleanup March 1, 2025 to June 22,

Section 2:
2025.
WHEREAS, it is the pleasure of the members of this General Assembly to acknowledge
and applaud those community initiatives that foster collaboration among citizens toward a
common good; and
WHEREAS, one such event is the Great American Cleanup, a grassroots spring-
cleaning movement that prompts individuals to take greater responsibility for their local
environment through service projects that engage volunteers, local businesses, and civic
leaders; and
WHEREAS, now in its twenty-sixth year, the Great American Cleanup created 15,000
opportunities for millions of volunteers in 2024, with remarkable results—volunteers picked up
millions of pounds of litter, cleaning over 100,000 acres of public spaces and tens of thousands
of miles of roadways and shorelines; and
WHEREAS, spearheading Tennessee's participation in the Great American Cleanup is
Keep Tennessee Beautiful, the state-level affiliate of Keep America Beautiful; Keep Tennessee
Beautiful serves as a statewide resource for litter prevention, community greening, and recycling
and waste reduction education; and
WHEREAS, Keep Tennessee Beautiful is housed at the University of Memphis as an
independent department within the University of Memphis Center for Regional Economic
Enrichment as a community engagement program and is a grant-funded organization
sponsored by the Tennessee Department of Transportation; and

WHEREAS, in addition to the immediate, pragmatic results of the Great American
Cleanup, the initiative promotes the value of teamwork and the synergy that results when
concerned citizens work in concert toward an altruistic end; certainly, this effort will continue to
instill a sense of pride in citizens throughout the State and engender goodwill among its
volunteers; and
WHEREAS, it is most fitting that we commend Keep Tennessee Beautiful and
acknowledge its efforts toward making the Great American Cleanup a success; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we hereby join with Keep Tennessee Beautiful in commemorating the
twenty-sixth annual Great American Cleanup, extending our sincere gratitude to all involved with
this worthy initiative.
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that an appropriate copy of this resolution be prepared
for presentation with this final clause omitted from such copy and upon proper request made to
the appropriate clerk, the language appearing immediately following the State seal appear
without House or Senate designation.
