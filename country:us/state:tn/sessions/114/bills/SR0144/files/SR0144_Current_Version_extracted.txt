Section 1:
SENATE RESOLUTION 144
By Bailey
A RESOLUTION to honor and commend the Upperman Bees
boys' basketball team upon winning the 2025
TSSAA Division I, Class 3A state championship.
WHEREAS, it is fitting that this General Assembly should salute those student athletes
who, through their extraordinary efforts, have distinguished themselves as true champions of
whom we can all be proud; and
WHEREAS, one such exemplary group of lads is the Bees boys' basketball team of
Upperman High School in Baxter, whose members have proven themselves to be the fiercest of
competitors and truly worthy of admiration by winning the 2025 TSSAA Division I, Class 3A
state championship, the first such title in school history after eight previous state tournament
appearances; and
WHEREAS, entering regional competition as District 7 champions, Upperman defeated
Lawrence County 58-53 in the quarterfinals and crushed Giles County 54-33 in their semifinal
match-up before falling in the regional final; and
WHEREAS, quickly rebounding in the sectional round, the Bees easily buzzed by
Heritage 51-33 to punch their ticket for the Big Dance; and
WHEREAS, poised for ultimate victory in the Class 3A state tournament at MTSU's
Murphy Center, Upperman stung Hume-Fogg 54-40 in the quarterfinals and bested Greeneville
55-47 in the semifinal round to advance; and
WHEREAS, in the final game, the Bees avenged their sole loss in regional play by
taming the Tullahoma Wildcats 65-55 to claim the Gold Ball trophy that signifies a state
champion and finish the 2024-2025 campaign with an outstanding 32-3 record; and

WHEREAS, the following young men made sweet championship honey as the Bees
from Baxter: the Class 3A state tournament's Most Valuable Player, Ty Cobb; All-Tournament
team selections, Bronzden Chaffin and Evan Huddleston; and contributing players, Jack
Torrence, Branson Turnbow, Collier Bush, Colton Johnson, and John Sissom; and
WHEREAS, Upperman's superb performance would not have been possible without the
expert guidance of Head Coach Bobby McWilliams and his assistant coaches, Alan Asberry,
Brian Johnson, and Austyn McWilliams, and the unfailing support of the players' families, their
fans, and the close-knit Baxter community; and
WHEREAS, the members of the Upperman boys' basketball team epitomize all that is
good in today's student athletes, as they have achieved a premier level of success in
competition while exhibiting the highest degree of character in all aspects of life; and
WHEREAS, the perseverance, determination, work ethic, and talent of this group of
young men not only made possible a championship but also surely bode well for their future
success; and
WHEREAS, the members of this General Assembly find it appropriate to acknowledge
and applaud the Upperman Bees for their outstanding season on the hardwood; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, that we honor and commend the
Upperman Bees boys' basketball team upon winning the 2025 TSSAA Division I, Class 3A state
championship and extend to them our best wishes for every continued success in all their future
