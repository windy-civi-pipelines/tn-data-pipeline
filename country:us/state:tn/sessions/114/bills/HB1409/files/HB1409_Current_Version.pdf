classification are less than the amount estimated to be available under the allotments

this act and the revised summaries cited above. No state agency shall establish any
new programs or expand any existing programs, beyond the scope of those already
established, recognized and approved by the General Assembly, as reflected in this act
and the revised summaries cited above, unless each such new or expanded program is

revenues. However, no such expenditure of unanticipated or excess departmental
revenues or federal revenues shall occur until written notice of the program and the
availability of unanticipated or excess departmental revenues or federal revenues is
submitted by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to the Chairs of the

Homeland Security grant programs are subject to the following provisions:
- 130 - 003682

(a) The allotment of these funds is subject to approval of the
Commissioner of Finance and Administration, and the distribution among state
and local agencies shall be subject to approval of or under procedures of the
state Homeland Security Council.
(b) The Commissioner of Finance and Administration is hereby
authorized to reallocate appropriations within the affected state agencies and to
reallocate homeland security appropriations among the affected agencies for the
purpose of providing the required state match to these and other federal
homeland security and bioterrorism grants; to adjust position authorizations
among affected departments, offices, and programs for that purpose; and to
adjust federal and other departmental revenue estimates accordingly. The
commissioner shall file any such reallocations or adjustments with the Fiscal
Review Committee and the Office of Legislative Budget Analysis.
Item 2. There are appropriated sums sufficient to the Department of Safety,
Office of Homeland Security, from federal grant funds and to other agencies of state
government receiving homeland security federal grant funds.
Item 3. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, the unexpended balance of the

Section 52, Item 3 and in Section 1, Title III-20, Item 4, may be reserved to be carried

SECTION 53. Federal Program Reductions. The General Assembly recognizes that
reductions in federal grants-in-aid of federal programs by the United States government will
require extraordinary actions by the Commissioner of Finance and Administration to manage the
state budget within available resources and without detrimental effect on state finances. It is the
legislative intent that the reduced programs not be maintained at their former level by
substituting state funds for the reduced federal aid.
Item 1. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Finance and Administration shall
reduce the federal and other departmental revenue estimates and reduce the allotment
of funds in an amount equal to the revenue reductions, in accordance with Section 23,
Item 1, it being the legislative intent that such withdrawal of federal aid necessitates a
reduction of spending authorization in order to protect the state finances.
- 131 - 003682

Item 2. The commissioner also shall reduce the number of authorized positions
of each program affected by the federal aid reductions, to the extent positions were
funded by the federal aid being reduced.
Item 3. State funds appropriated to match federal aid that has been reduced
shall be set aside in an allotment reserve of the affected program and shall not be
expended except to the extent necessary to provide for severance benefits and other
actions necessary to reduce programs; provided, however, that the allotment of state
funds shall be authorized to the extent necessary to fulfill state maintenance-of-effort
(MOE) requirements under federal law. To the extent that state MOE requirements are
reduced by the federal programs, state funds in the amount of the allowable MOE
reduction also shall be reserved and not expended, except as provided above in this
item. The provisions of this item shall not operate to require the reserving of state funds
that have been appropriated in excess of the previous level of required state match or
MOE in order to enhance the affected joint federal-state program.
Item 4. It is the legislative intent that the state matching funds held in allotment
reserve as a result of these actions revert to the appropriate fund balance at June 30,
2026, in addition to the amounts estimated in the over-appropriation in Section 43 of this
act, and that such funds as may be estimated at mid-year, when the 2026-2027 Budget
is transmitted, be available for the Governor's budget recommendations for the
maintenance of any priority program services, if approved in the 2026 appropriations bill
enacted by the General Assembly.
Item 5. The Commissioner of Finance and Administration, by December 31,
2025, shall report to the Senate and House Finance, Ways and Means committees and
the directors of the Office of Legislative Budget Analysis on the reductions made by
department and by state program, including the amounts of federal and other
departmental revenue and allotments reduced, the matching state appropriations held in
reserve and not allotted, the number of positions reduced, and a general summary of the
impact on program services. After the report date, the commissioner shall provide any
updated information in a fiscal year-end report encompassing the same categories of
information, if the program reductions have changed from the earlier report.
