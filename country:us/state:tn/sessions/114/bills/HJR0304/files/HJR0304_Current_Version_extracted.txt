Section 1:
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 304
By Alexander
A RESOLUTION to honor the disabled victims of filicide on the
Day of Mourning in the State of Tennessee.
WHEREAS, every year on March 1st, the disability community gathers across the nation
for a Day of Mourning to remember the disabled victims of filicide, that is, people murdered by
their family members or caregivers; and
WHEREAS, these murders are often portrayed as justifiable and inevitable due to the
perceived "burden" of having a disabled person in the family; and
WHEREAS, victims' lives are therefore assumed to have lesser value because of their
disability; and
WHEREAS, disability is a natural part of the human experience; and
WHEREAS, prevention of filicide requires increased awareness; and
WHEREAS, many victims' names remain unknown or without acknowledgement, and it
is most appropriate that we remember and honor the victims from Tennessee who tragically lost
their lives; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE HUNDRED
FOURTEENTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE SENATE
CONCURRING, that we respectfully pay tribute to and honor the lives of Chuckey Sweeten, age
