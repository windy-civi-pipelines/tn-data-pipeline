SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 191
By Gardenhire
A RESOLUTION to honor Wyatt Davis on winning the Class A
wrestling state championship in his weight class.
WHEREAS, we take great pleasure in recognizing those dedicated student athletes who
serve as the heart and soul of their schools and communities while wearing the crown of a
champion; and
WHEREAS, Wyatt Davis recently won the 2025 TSSAA Class A wresting state
championship in the 144-pound weight class to distinguish himself as the first individual state
champion in any sport in Whitwell High School history; and
WHEREAS, in the final match of the state tournament, Wyatt Davis overcame a 6-0
deficit to beat an opponent who entered the final with a 51-0 season record; and
WHEREAS, Wyatt showcased his impressive power and relentless pace to overcome
the early deficit, secure an 11-8 decision, and claim the state championship; and
WHEREAS, Mr. Davis's path to the state championship was a most difficult one; the
Class A 144-pound bracket featured five returning state placers, while Wyatt won his final two
matches against wrestlers who had a combined season record of 108-4; and
WHEREAS, he not only defeated a previously unbeaten wrestler in the final, but he also
bounced back from a 1-4 deficit in the second period of a tough semifinal matchup to pin his
opponent at the 3:36 mark; and
WHEREAS, Wyatt Davis posted an 11-5 decision in the first round of the state tourney
and a dominating 17-1 tech fall in the quarterfinals; and
WHEREAS, Wyatt Davis had won back-to-back regional and sectional championships
for the Tigers before finishing this season with a 22-3 overall record and state championship
laurels; and

WHEREAS, Mr. Davis modestly attributes his success to hard work and perseverance
on his part, and the inspired instruction of Coach Thomas Argo; and
WHEREAS, an outstanding overall athlete, Wyatt Davis also stars for a Whitwell Tigers
football team that has produced 25 wins over the last three seasons with the help of his 17
touchdowns, 162 tackles, two interceptions, and two blocked field goal attempts; and
WHEREAS, as his legacy on the wrestling mat assumes its rightful place in Whitwell's
athletic history, Wyatt Davis hopes his triumph will inspire more students to join the school's
wrestling program; and
WHEREAS, Wyatt Davis has distinguished himself as a dominant champion of whom we
can all be proud, and he is worthy of our approbation; now, therefore,
BE IT RESOLVED BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTEENTH
GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE, THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING, that we honor and congratulate Wyatt Davis of the
Whitwell High School Tigers on winning the Class A wrestling state championship in the 144-
