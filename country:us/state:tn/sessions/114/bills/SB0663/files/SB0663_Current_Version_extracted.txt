platform, technology, or mechanism that:
(i) Must not unfairly disadvantage another controller;

any processing of a consumer's personal data;
(iii) Must be consumer-friendly and easy to use by the
average consumer;
(iv) Must be consistent with any federal or state law or

consumer's personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising, or any
sale of personal data, through an opt-out preference signal sent in
accordance with subdivision (d)(3) conflicts with the consumer's existing
controller-specific privacy setting or voluntary participation in a controller's
bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card

program, then the controller shall comply with the consumer's opt-out
preference signal but may notify the consumer of the conflict and provide
the choice to confirm controller-specific privacy settings or participation in

in accordance with subdivision (d)(3) by informing the consumer of a
charge for the use of any product or service, then the controller shall
